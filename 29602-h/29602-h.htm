<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>REWARDS OFFERED</h3>
</div>
<p>The sign on the tree attracted the man&#8217;s attention
while he was still far down the slope. He could
see the tall pine on the crest of the ridge above
a veritable landmark in that country of stunted timber,
and the square of paper, tacked to its trunk
under the lowest branches, gleamed white against
the background of vivid green.</p>
<p>The air was clear, and every detail of the landscape&ndash;&ndash;the
red rocks, the saffron-colored slopes, the
green pines and firs and buck brush, the white cliffs&ndash;&ndash;everything
within sight for miles stood out, clean-cut
in the brilliant sunshine which flooded the empty
land under a cloudless sky.</p>
<p>When the man, mounted on a lean, dun-colored
horse, first looked up at a turn of the narrow trail
and saw the sign, he grunted. Then he frowned
and looked back along the way he had come with
a glowing light of reflection in his gray eyes. He
was a tall man, slim and muscular, clean-shaven, his
face and hands bronzed by sun and wind, and his
face open and good-natured. A shock of blond
hair showed where his gray, wide-brimmed, high-crowned
hat was pushed back from his high forehead.</p>
<p>His dress, though typical of the country which
he traversed, was distinctive, or it might have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
a certain natural grace that made it seem so. He
wore a light-gray, soft shirt made of French flannel,
a dark-blue silk scarf, leather chaps over olive-drab
khaki trousers, black, hand-sewed riding boots which
displayed their polish despite a coating of fine dust,
silver spurs, and, strapped to his right thigh, was
a worn leather holster, natural color, from which
protruded the black butt of a six-gun.</p>
<p>On the back of his saddle was tied a black
slicker, the raincoat of the open country, which
bulged with a medium-sized pack done up within it.</p>
<p>One would have taken him to be thirty, perhaps
a year or two more when his face was serious;
but when he smiled, that is, when he smiled naturally,
he looked little more in years than a youth who has
just attained his majority.</p>
<p>When he smiled the other smile&ndash;&ndash;the smile he
now expressed as he looked up the slope toward
the tall pine with the white square of paper on its
trunk&ndash;&ndash;one would have forgotten the smile because
of the sinister, steel-blue look in his eyes, and the
direct, piercing quality of his gaze.</p>
<p>He walked his horse up the winding trail. His
right foot was clear of the stirrup, and he swung
it idly. His left hand, in which he held the reins,
rested lightly on the horn of his saddle, and his
right gripped the cantle at his back. He hummed
a ditty of the desert, but his gaze, keen and alert,
continually sought the open stretches of trail above
him, and at regular intervals flashed back along
the way he had come.</p>
<p>In time he reached the top of the ridge and
pulled up his horse near the tree bearing the poster.
He dismounted and walked slowly up a little grade
to where he could the better read the legend on the
paper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>It was printed in large letters, but recent rain
had somewhat faded it.</p>
<p class='center'>FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD<br />
This will be paid for<br />
THE COYOTE<br />
dead or alive, by San Jacinto County.<br />
JUDSON BROWN, J. P.,<br />
Dry Lake.</p>
<p>This man is tall and light in complexion,
gray or blue eyes, good teeth, his horse said
branded
CC<span style='font-size:smaller'>2</span>
keeps himself neat, dangerous
with gun, squints when mad. Bring him in
and get the money.</p>
<p>The man swore softly as he read the last sentence.
&#8220;Bring him in an&#8217; get the money,&#8221; he said snortingly.
&#8220;You&#8217;d think they was talkin&#8217; about a locoed
steer that just had to be roped an&#8217; drug, or shot
an&#8217; hauled. Bring him in an&#8217; get the money!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was genuine indignation in his tone as
he repeated the offensive sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it can&#8217;t be me,&#8221; he said facetiously, aloud.
&#8220;My name&#8217;s Rathburn&ndash;&ndash;a right good name.&#8221; His
eyes clouded. &#8220;A right good name till they began
to tamper with it,&#8221; he muttered with a frown as
he lit a cigarette he had built while perusing the
placard.</p>
<p>He took the stub of a lead pencil from the pocket
of his shirt. For some moments he reflected, staring
at the sign on the tree trunk. Then he laboriously
printed on its lower edge:</p>
<p>Five thousand dollars more from the State
of Arizona if you can get it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>Rathburn surveyed his work with a grin, replacing
the pencil in his shirt pocket. Then he stepped
back and drew his gun. He seemed on the point
of sending a half dozen bullets through the paper
when he suddenly shook his head, glanced hurriedly
about him, and shoved the weapon back into its
sheath.</p>
<p>He walked quickly to his horse, swung into the
saddle, and started down the trail on the western
side of the ridge.</p>
<p>Below him he saw a far-flung vista of rounded,
yellow hills, spotted with the green of small pines
and firs. The ground was hard, dry, and gravelly.
There were boulders a-plenty, and long, sharp-edged
outcroppings of hard rock of a reddish hue. There
was no sign of habitation to be glimpsed from the
trail leading down from the high ridge which he
had crossed. He continually looked about him with
the interested air of a man who is venturing into a
new locality with which he is not familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dry Lake!&#8221; he exclaimed, while his horse pricked
up its ears at the familiar voice. &#8220;Good name for
it, if it&#8217;s anywhere in <i>this</i> country. Hoss, I don&#8217;t
know when we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to drink again. I didn&#8217;t
figure on hittin&#8217; a desert up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rode on at a brisk jog, down and down the
winding trail. Then it led across a number of the
round, low hills, ever westward.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, more green brightened
the landscape and patches of grass appeared. Then
they came upon a small stream trickling down from
the higher slopes to northward where horse and
rider drank their fill and rested in a quiet, secluded
meadow off the trail.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face was a study as he lay back upon
the grass in the cool shade of a clump of pines.
Whimsical and wistful, it was occasionally lit by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
a peculiar smile which carried a hint of sadness.
His eyes half closed, dreamily. The smoke from
his cigarette curled upward in a thin spiral in the
still air of the altitudes. His horse, with reins
dangling and saddle cinch loosened, cropped the
grass which carpeted the meadow.</p>
<p>Finally the man arose, tightened the cinch in an
absent manner, mounted, and rode back to the trail
to continue on his way. At the top of the next
ridge he halted, looking at a little ranch which
lay in a wide valley a mile or two north of the
thread of trail which he could see winding westward.
The place looked poor, poverty-stricken, despite
the small field of living green south of the
house and the few head of cattle grazing along
the banks of a little stream which wound through
the valley.</p>
<p>For some time the rider sat his horse motionless,
frowning in indecision. Then he touched the dun
lightly with his spurs, left the trail, and struck off
to the north, following the ridge. He kept his
gaze focused on the little ranch. The only sign
of life which he saw was a heavily-burdened clothesline
flapping in the idle breeze which at this point
was wafted down from the mountains.</p>
<p>When he was almost directly above the small
house he turned his mount down the slope and
gaining the floor of the valley, rode at a gallop
for the house. His right hand now rested on his
thigh near the holstered gun.</p>
<p>As he brought his horse to a stop near the front
of the house a girl appeared in the doorway. He
looked at her in pleased surprise. Then his hat
swept low in a gesture of courtesy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ve found this to be a country of scattered
habitations,&#8221; he said in a musical bass. &#8220;So
when I glimpsed your abode from yonder hills I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
said to myself, &#8216;Rathburn, you&#8217;re most powerful
hungry; maybe you better pay a call.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were glowing with an amused light,
and a pleasant smile played upon his lips.</p>
<p>The girl, who had listened curiously, now laughed
in welcome. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t many places between
here and Dry Lake,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and I guess it
would be a pretty hot ride to-day. You can water
your horse&ndash;&ndash;and feed him at the barn, if you wish&ndash;&ndash;and
I&#8217;ll get you something to eat, if you&#8217;re not
particular.&#8221; Her eyes danced merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am!&#8221; he exclaimed, with mock severity, &#8220;I
quit bein&#8217; particular when I was&ndash;&ndash;when I was as
young as that youngster.&#8221;</p>
<p>A boy of ten or twelve had appeared beside the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man, what&#8217;re those dirt-looking spots on
your face?&#8221; asked the stranger, frowning with his
eyes but smiling with his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;They <i>ain&#8217;t</i> dirt spots!&#8221; returned the boy with
spirit, advancing a step.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said the man, feigning intense astonishment.
&#8220;What <i>are</i> they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re freckles,&#8221; answered the boy stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;oh, <i>that&#8217;s</i> what they are,&#8221; said the stranger
with a delighted laugh. &#8220;Won&#8217;t they wash off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw. You can&#8217;t fool me. You knew what they
were!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, maybe so,&#8221; observed the man as the
girl laughingly turned inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grub&#8217;ll be ready by time you are,&#8221; she called
back to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you where to put your horse,&#8221; said the
boy as the man looked searchingly up and down the
valley.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A BOY AND A GIRL</h3>
</div>
<p>When Rathburn had put up his horse, after
giving him a light feed of grain in the barn,
he followed the boy to the rear of the house where
he found water, soap, and a towel on a bench, above
which hung a small mirror.</p>
<p>The boy left him there, and he soon washed and
combed his hair. The girl opened the rear door
for him and he walked through the little kitchen
into a small front room where a table was set for
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, ma&#8217;am, I didn&#8217;t figure on causing you so
much trouble,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
expect anything but a snack, an&#8217; here you&#8217;ve gone
an&#8217; fixed a regular dinner&ndash;&ndash;this time of day, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My experience with men in this country has
taught me that when they&#8217;re hungry, they&#8217;re hungry,&#8221;
replied the girl. &#8220;And it wasn&#8217;t much trouble.
Those beans were in the oven and already warm. I
just had to make the coffee. I was expecting my
brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any men around the place,&#8221; he said,
beginning to eat. &#8220;If I had I&#8217;d have made myself
known to them before coming to the house. Where
is he&ndash;&ndash;out with the cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw her gaze was troubled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
just where he is&ndash;&ndash;to-day,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;He goes
away and sometimes doesn&#8217;t come back for a day
or two.&#8221; She stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>Rathburn noted her trim, slim figure and her
wealth of chestnut hair. She was pretty and capable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
He surmised that her parents were dead, although
he could not ascribe the reason for this deduction.
Evidently the boy was a younger brother. He wondered
if the older brother would return before he
finished eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it to Dry Lake?&#8221; he asked casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;why, didn&#8217;t you come from there?&#8221; She
seemed surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I came from over to eastward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s miles and miles to any place east of
here, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked, puzzled. &#8220;You must have
had a long ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>A ghost of a frown played on his brows. Then
he laughed. &#8220;Yes, miss, I&#8217;ve been ridin&#8217; some,&#8221; he
confessed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how far it was to anywhere
or I mightn&#8217;t have come in this direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him wonderingly, and again he
thought he saw a troubled look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to Dry Lake?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said shortly, and a grim note crept
into his voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s west of here, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About fifteen or eighteen miles,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;The trail leads there from the lower end of this
valley&ndash;&ndash;the same trail you came on, I guess. Are
you a cow-puncher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I look like one, miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do and&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t.&#8221; She was confused
by the quality of his smile. But his eyes
seemed to glow at her kindly, with a cheerful,
amused light&ndash;&ndash;altogether honest and friendly. She
lowered her gaze and flushed despite herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;My vocation, miss&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re too young an&#8217; pretty
to be called ma&#8217;am, if you&#8217;ll excuse me for saying
so&ndash;&ndash;is a peculiar one. I&#8217;ve punched cows, yes; I&#8217;ve
prospected an&#8217; worked a bit in the mines. I&#8217;ve
scared the wolf from the &#8216;Welcome&#8217; mat by standing
off the boys at green-topped tables, an&#8217; once I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;worked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
on a sort of farm.&#8221; He appeared apologetic
as he confessed this last. &#8220;I guess I wasn&#8217;t cut
out for a farm hand, miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed at this. &#8220;Are you going to work
in Dry Lake?&#8221; she asked, sobering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, that is a question,&#8221; he returned,
draining his cup of the last of the coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you some more,&#8221; she said quickly, taking
his cup. &#8220;Dry Lake isn&#8217;t a very big place, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just how big <i>is</i> Dry Lake?&#8221; he asked when she
returned from the kitchen with more coffee for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a hundred or two. But the men from
miles and miles go there because&ndash;&ndash;because there are
places there where they can stand the wolf off at
the green-topped tables and&ndash;&ndash;drink.&#8221; The troubled
look was in her eyes again. &#8220;Sometimes the wolf
catches up with them before they get home,&#8221; she
added, smiling faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a safe system,&#8221; he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you might get work in Dry Lake,&#8221; she
said hopefully. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you look capable. The cattlemen
from back in the hills go there and they&#8217;re
nearly always looking for men, I&#8217;ve heard. You
might meet some of them and get a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>He beamed upon her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always heard that
a woman gave a man encouragement an&#8217; ambition,
if she was a good one,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;You&#8217;ve almost
got me thinking I&#8217;d better go straight to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;wasn&#8217;t that your intention?&#8221; she
asked wonderingly.</p>
<p>His face clouded. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t always so easy for
me to do what I want to do, miss,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;you
see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He broke off his speech with a frown.
&#8220;This is a queer country, miss,&#8221; he said earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re
an&ndash;&ndash;an officer!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>Then he laughed. It was the spontaneous laugh
of youth, vibrant, compelling, mirth-inspiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, miss, if there&#8217;s one thing I ain&#8217;t tackled yet,
it&#8217;s being an officer,&#8221; he chuckled as he finished his
repast.</p>
<p>She smiled vaguely, studying him under her long,
dark lashes. The boy came into the room, holding
his hands behind him, and stood with his sturdy
legs braced apart, staring at Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is now!&#8221; Rathburn exclaimed. &#8220;Did
you try to wash the freckles off?&#8221; he queried with
a wink.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know who <i>you</i> are!&#8221; said the boy. There was
admiration and awe in his wide eyes.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked at him closely, his brows wrinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; said the boy, nodding. &#8220;Did he
tell you who he is, sis?&#8221; he asked, looking at the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Frankie, we don&#8217;t care who the man is,&#8221;
she reproved. &#8220;He was hungry and he&#8217;s welcome.
What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;d be surprised if you knew as much
as I do,&#8221; the boy boasted. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;d be surprised
all right. I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been surprised more than once at things
you knew,&#8221; the girl said with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I guess you&#8217;d be surprised all right
if you knew who <i>he</i> is,&#8221; cried the boy, pointing at
Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now, young fellow, don&#8217;t be getting all
het up here,&#8221; said Rathburn slowly, drawing tobacco
and papers from his shirt pocket. &#8220;What do you
find to do with yourself around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the youngster was not to be diverted from
his topic. &#8220;I was lookin&#8217; at your horse,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
his eyes shining. &#8220;That&#8217;s how I know for sure
an&#8217; certain who you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn gazed at the boy sternly as he touched
a match to his brown-paper cigarette. &#8220;My horse
is all right, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure he is,&#8221; said the boy eagerly. &#8220;I bet he
can go some, too. He&#8217;d have to go for you to
have him, wouldn&#8217;t he? You&#8217;re The Coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn continued to smile with an amused tolerance.
But the girl gave a start; her hands flew
to her breast, and she stared at the man with wide-open
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankie! What are you saying?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The boy triumphantly brought his hands from behind
his back. He held out a poster.</p>
<p>&#8220;His horse has got CC2 for a brand, just like it
says in this bill Ed brought from town!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;He&#8217;s The Coyote, all right. But I won&#8217;t tell,&#8221; he
added quickly, looking at Rathburn.</p>
<p>The man avoided the girl&#8217;s eyes. The boy laid
the poster on the table where she could read it again,
word for word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tall&ndash;&ndash;light in complexion&ndash;&ndash;gray or blue eyes&ndash;&ndash;good
teeth&ndash;&ndash;horse branded CC2&ndash;&ndash;dangerous&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this man was tall and blond, with gray eyes.
Five hundred dollars reward!</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell anybody you&#8217;ve been here,&#8221; the boy
continued. &#8220;We won&#8217;t tell, will we, sis?&#8221; He
looked at the girl imploringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother Ed says what you want you take,&#8221;
said the boy, gazing at the man in admiration. &#8220;An&#8217;
he says you don&#8217;t rob anybody that can&#8217;t afford it!
He says the banks are insured an&#8217; you&#8217;ve been a
friend to more&#8217;n one that&#8217;s just gettin&#8217; a start in
the cattle. I won&#8217;t tell anybody you&#8217;ve been here,
an&#8217; I won&#8217;t let sis tell anybody, either!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn was smiling wistfully. &#8220;Always tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
the truth, sonny,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget that. I wouldn&#8217;t want you to lie for me.
Any man that would want you to lie for him
wouldn&#8217;t be a man a-tall, son. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But old Brown, the judge, or the sheriff might
come along an&#8217; want to know if you&#8217;d been here!&#8221;
said the boy in breathless excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell &#8217;em the truth,&#8221; said Rathburn smilingly.
&#8220;Tell &#8217;em a man with a horse branded CC2 was here
an&#8217; kidded you about your freckles, had something
to eat, an&#8217; rode away. Don&#8217;t lie, sonny, no matter
what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl took a step toward the table. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;<i>are</i>&ndash;&ndash;The
Coyote?&#8221; she asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Rathburn, miss,&#8221; he replied cheerfully.
&#8220;In some ways I&#8217;m a lot like the man described
in that reward notice. An&#8217; I&#8217;m riding a
dun-colored horse branded CC2. I don&#8217;t like that
monicker, Coyote, or I might &#8217;fess up to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;if you&#8217;re him&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re an outlaw!&#8221; she
stammered.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s dreamy look shifted to the boy who
was staring at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll grow up to be quite a man, son,&#8221; he said
in a fatherly tone. &#8220;Those freckles mean a tough
skin. A weak sort of skin tans quick an&#8217; the
toughest just sunburns. You&#8217;re halfway between.
That&#8217;s all right for freckles; but it don&#8217;t go in life.
It&#8217;s best to be on one side or the other, an&#8217; the
right side&#8217;s the best for most folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and went for his hat. Then he extracted
a roll of bills from a hip pocket and laid a five-dollar
note on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;That meal was worth it,&#8221; he said to the girl
with a smile.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t take it,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s clean money, miss. I earned it circumventin&#8217;
three of the most ornery card sharps in
Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued to shake her head. &#8220;You do not
understand,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;it wouldn&#8217;t make
any difference. We couldn&#8217;t take money from a
stranger who came to us&ndash;&ndash;hungry. It wouldn&#8217;t
make any difference who you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, we need it, sis!&#8221; blurted out the boy. &#8220;The
Coyote&#8217;s all right. He wouldn&#8217;t lie to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed and, stepping to the boy, ran
his fingers in his hair. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve made a friend,&#8221;
he said in a wistful voice. Then he picked up
the bill on the table and stuffed it into the boy&#8217;s
pocket. His eyes encountered the poster again and
they clouded. He turned away from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss, you&#8217;ll let me thank you&ndash;&ndash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, retreating a few paces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221; he said, stepping to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;To&ndash;&ndash;to Dry Lake?&#8221; she found the voice to ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. To Dry Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the house and in a few minutes reappeared
from the direction of the barn, riding his dun-colored
horse. He did not stop, but galloped down
the valley, waving a hand in farewell which the boy
answered.</p>
<p>The day was nearly spent. The sun was low in
the west, sliding down like a ball of gold toward
the rim of the blue mountains. A stiff breeze had
sprung up, driving the heat before it. At the lower
end of the valley Rathburn found the trail he had
left when he detoured to the ranch. He turned
westward upon it, put spurs to his horse, and sped
toward town.</p>
<p>It was just as well that the girl could not see
the look which came to his face as he rode into the
sunset.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE LAW</h3>
</div>
<p>Night had descended when Rathburn came in
sight of the little town on the edge of the
foothills. He rode slowly toward it, staring moodily
at the flickering lights between interlaced branches
which waved and weaved in the wind blowing down
from the mountains. In all the distance he had
traveled from the lonely ranch where he had met
the girl and the boy he had encountered no one.
He surmised that the trail to the desert hills to eastward
was not a popular one.</p>
<p>As he neared the town he saw that it consisted
of one main street with buildings clustered about it,
and numerous shacks scattered in the lee of the
hills. There were trees close to the eastern end of
the street which he was approaching, and when he
reached these trees he dismounted, led his horse into
the shadows, and tied it.</p>
<p>He walked down the main street, which was illuminated
only by the stars and the yellow gleams of
light from windows on either side.</p>
<p>There were several resorts, and one in particular
seemed the most popular. Rathburn glanced in
through the door of this place as he passed and
saw that it consisted of a bar and numerous tables,
where games were in progress. He did not stop
but continued on his way.</p>
<p>Few people were on the street; none of them
took any especial notice of him. Several doors
below the largest resort which he had so casually
investigated, he came to a small, one-story, white-painted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
building, which, save for the door and window
in its front, looked like a huge box.</p>
<p>Across the glass in the door was lettered in gold:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='smcap'>JUDSON BROWN</span><br />
Justice of the Peace<br />
Notary Public</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>A dim light shone within, and, peering through
the window, Rathburn saw that this light came from
a lamp in a second room behind the little front office.</p>
<p>He looked up and down the street and saw but
two pedestrians, both walking up the other side of
the thoroughfare with their back to him. He tried
the door stealthily, found it unlocked, and stepped
quickly inside. Three strides took him to the door
of the inside room.</p>
<p>A man looked up from a small table where he
was engaged in writing. He was a stout man, large
of countenance, with small black eyes under bushy
brows which were black, although his hair was gray.
He scowled heavily at the intruder who failed to
remove his hat, and who stood, with feet well apart,
in the doorway, a whimsical smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>In a sweeping glance Rathburn saw that the room
contained a bed, wardrobe closet, several chairs, and
other articles of furniture and decoration of a bedroom
and living room. His eyes flashed back to
the burly man sitting at the table, pen poised, coolly
surveying him with a frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name Jud Brown?&#8221; he asked, stepping inside
the room and to the side of the door toward
the table where he could not be seen from the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>Judge</i> Brown,&#8221; replied the large man testily.
&#8220;You should have knocked before you came in,
but now you&#8217;re here, state your business as quickly
as possible.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a businesslike tone that I admire to hear,
Brown,&#8221; drawled Rathburn. &#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse my not
callin&#8217; you judge. I&#8217;m afraid when you find out
who I am you&#8217;d think I was kiddin&#8217; you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled amiably while the justice glared angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re drunk!&#8221; flared Brown. &#8220;The best thing
you can do is get out of here&ndash;&ndash;quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn looked pained. &#8220;First you ask me to
state my business an&#8217; now you tell me to get out,&#8221;
he complained. &#8220;You might as well know that I
never touch likker,&#8221; he added convincingly.</p>
<p>Brown was studying him intently with a puzzled
look on his face. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said finally, with a
show of irritation, &#8220;what do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me the why an&#8217; the wherefores
of this document,&#8221; said Rathburn sternly as he drew
a folded piece of paper from a pocket and spread
it out on the table before the astonished gaze of
the justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of a number I saw tacked on trees
on the east trail out of here,&#8221; continued Rathburn,
frowning. &#8220;What&#8217;s it all about, Brown?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pen in the hand of the justice suddenly began
to waver as the hand trembled. Then Brown dropped
it, squared away his chair, and looked grimly at his
nocturnal visitor. For some moments his gaze was
concentrated on Rathburn&#8217;s face. Then he slowly
read the poster offering a reward of five hundred
dollars for The Coyote. He wet his lips with his
tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I was right!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You <i>were</i>
headed in this direction. I&#8217;m assuming that you&#8217;re
The Coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re assuming what&#8217;s the bare, untarnished
truth,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;I&#8217;m The Coyote you&#8217;ve
offered five hundred for, an&#8217; who&#8217;ll bring another
five hundred in several counties in Arizona, not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
mention five thousand that the State of Arizona has
tossed into the pot. I suppose I&#8217;m worth at least
ten thousand as I stand here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be cheap for a man of your reputation!&#8221;
said the justice bravely. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want you
across the line in California, Coyote. We won&#8217;t
put up with your depredations, and if you murder
one of our citizens you&#8217;ll hang!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s chilling laugh hung upon the justice&#8217;s
words. &#8220;You&#8217;re side-stepping the point,&#8221; he said
suddenly in crisp tones that were like the crack
of a whiplash. &#8220;You&#8217;re anticipating events, Jud.
That&#8217;s my complaint&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s my business here with
you.&#8221; He brought his right palm down upon the
table smartly.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now that I&#8217;m here, Jud, you&#8217;re sure goin&#8217;
to listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t threaten me!&#8221; cried the justice. &#8220;There
are a hundred men within call and they&#8217;d make short
work of you if they got their hands on you. Darn
your ornery hide, I&#8217;m holding the winning cards in
this game!&#8221; he concluded excitedly.</p>
<p>Rathburn was smiling at him; and it was not his
natural smile. It gave the justice pause as he looked
up into those narrowed gray eyes, shot with a steel-blue
light. Rathburn&#8217;s right hand and wrist moved
with incredible swiftness, and Brown found himself
staring into the black bore of a six-gun. Still he
saw the eyes above the weapon. His face blanched.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are six winning cards in my right hand,&#8221;
Rathburn said slowly. &#8220;You can start shoutin&#8217; for
those hundred men you mentioned just as soon as
you want. Brown, it&#8217;s you an&#8217; your kind that&#8217;s
made me desperate&ndash;&ndash;dangerous, like you said in that
printed notice. I won&#8217;t fool with you or any other
man on earth!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what did you come here for?&#8221; stammered
the justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get away from&ndash;&ndash;from back there in that
cactus-bordered country of black, lava hills where I
was born an&#8217; where I belong!&#8221; said Rathburn grimly,
sliding into a chair on the opposite side of the table
from Brown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me! I was driven out. I&#8217;ve ridden
for a week with the idea of gettin&#8217; where I wasn&#8217;t
known an&#8217; where I could maybe get a fresh start,
and here I find a reward notice staring me in the
face from the top of the first hill I cross after
leaving Arizona. I&#8217;ve never been here before; I&#8217;ve
done nothing to molest you or your town; but you
sic the pack on me first off an&#8217; hand-running, without
any reason, except that you&#8217;ve <i>heard</i> things about
me, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown nodded his head as Rathburn finished. A
measure of composure returned to him. His eyes
gleamed with cunning as he remembered that his
front door was unlocked and some one might by
chance come in. But he again felt troubled as he
conjectured what might happen in such event.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot blame me,&#8221; he said to Rathburn.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve robbed, and you&#8217;re a killer&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you <i>hear</i>?&#8221; thundered Rathburn. &#8220;I
admit several robberies&ndash;&ndash;holdups of crooked, gambling
joints like you&#8217;ve got in this town, an&#8217; petty-larceny
bankers who robbed poor stockmen with
sanction of the law. I&#8217;ve killed one man who had
it coming to him. But I&#8217;ve shouldered the blame
for every killing an&#8217; every robbery that&#8217;s been
staged in the desert country for the last three years.
&#8216;The Coyote did it,&#8217; is what they say, an&#8217; the crooks
an&#8217; gunmen that turned the deal go free. I&#8217;m talking
to you, Brown, as man to man&ndash;&ndash;a thing I&#8217;ve
never done with any mouthpiece of the law before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
I&#8217;m trying to show you how you an&#8217; your kind can
make a man an outlaw an&#8217; keep him one till somebody
shoots him down. I&#8217;m sore, Brown, because
I know that one of these days I&#8217;m going to get
it myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>The justice saw that the man was in deadly earnest.
He saw the hand resting on the table tighten its
grip upon the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know all these things,&#8221; he said hastily.
&#8220;I had to judge by what I heard&ndash;&ndash;and read. Why
didn&#8217;t you make all this known to the Arizona
authorities?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed harshly. &#8220;Because I&#8217;d be framed
clear across the board,&#8221; he said jeeringly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
law! It&#8217;s as much of a crime to rob a thieving
gambler or a snake of a whisky runner or peddler
as it is to rob a home! I&#8217;ve had to rob to live!
An&#8217; all the while there&#8217;s been the makings of one
of the hardest-lookin&#8217; bad men that this Southwest
country ever saw in me. And, now that I think
of it, why the devil I&#8217;ve held off I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown was moved by the sincerity of the man.
He saw in Rathburn&#8217;s eyes that he was speaking
the gospel truth. He saw something else in those
eyes&ndash;&ndash;the yearning of a homeless, friendless man,
stamped with the stigma of outlawry, rebelling
against the forces which were against him, relentlessly
hunting him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you came here to start over?&#8221; he asked
curiously. &#8220;How do I know you won&#8217;t walk right
out of this office and turn a trick right here in
this very town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know it, that&#8217;s the devil of it!&#8221; exclaimed
Rathburn. &#8220;An&#8217; there&#8217;s no use in my telling
you I won&#8217;t, for you wouldn&#8217;t take my word
for it. You&#8217;ve got me pegged for a gun-fightin&#8217;
bandit of first water an&#8217; clear crystal, an&#8217; I won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
try to wise you up because it wouldn&#8217;t do any good.
Now that you know I&#8217;m in this country, you&#8217;ll
blame the first wrong thing that happens on to me.
I&#8217;ve got no business here talking to you. I&#8217;m wasting
my breath. You&#8217;ll have to find out from somebody
besides me that I was telling you the truth,
an&#8217; I reckon that coincidence ain&#8217;t in the pictures.
Where&#8217;s your handcuffs?&#8221;</p>
<p>The justice stared at him, startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your handcuffs?&#8221; insisted Rathburn
angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the drawer of my desk out in front,&#8221; replied
Brown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go an&#8217; get &#8217;em an&#8217; bring &#8217;em here,&#8221; Rathburn
commanded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep my drop on you under cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown rose and went to his desk in the front
room while Rathburn watched him in the doorway
with his gun held under his coat.</p>
<p>When the justice returned to the inside room
Rathburn moved a chair close against one of the
bedposts. He compelled Brown to sit in the chair,
put his hands around between the supports in the
back, and about the bedpost. He handcuffed him
in that position.</p>
<p>Drawing a bandanna handkerchief from a pocket
he swiftly gagged the justice. Then he rummaged
about the room until he found a piece of rope tied
about a pack in the bottom of the wardrobe. With
this he secured Brown&#8217;s ankles to the front legs of
the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said, standing back to view his handiwork.
&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty well trussed up. I ain&#8217;t
trusting you any more than you&#8217;d trust me, an&#8217; I
don&#8217;t figure on you raising any hue an&#8217; cry before
I can get along on my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the justice were rolling as he struggled
in vain to speak.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;I reckon I know
what you want to say. Under the circumstances,
the same being so much on my side, you&#8217;d say you
believed me an&#8217; all that. But I took a chance in
coming here to tell you what I did an&#8217; I never aim
to take more&#8217;n one chance in a day. So long.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;I KNEW HE LIED!&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn extinguished the light in the lamp,
walked swiftly to the front door, and outside.
Closing the door softly he turned back up the street.
He sauntered along slowly, debating his next move.
Evidently the town was the last for many miles in
the mountainous country east and north. Westward
he would come upon many towns as the country
became more and more densely populated toward the
coast. Northwestward he would be able to keep
within the arm of the mountains and still be in
touch with civilization. But he would have to make
some changes in his attire and fix that brand on
his horse.</p>
<p>Instinctively his course brought him to the big
resort he had noticed upon his arrival. The entrance
doors had been closed against the chill of
the night, but he could see the interior of the place
through one of the windows despite the coating of
dust upon the glass.</p>
<p>As he peered within he stiffened to alert attention
and a light oath escaped him. Walking swiftly from
a rear door was a tall man, the lower part of his
face concealed by a black handkerchief. He held a
gun in each hand and was covering the score or
more patrons of the place who had risen from the
tables, or stepped back from the bar, with their
hands held high above their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep &#8217;em there an&#8217; you&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; the
masked man was saying in a loud voice which carried
to Rathburn through cracks in the window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
glass. &#8220;Line up down there, now&ndash;&ndash;you hear me?
Line up!&#8221;</p>
<p>The patrons lined up, keeping their faces toward
the bandit.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anybody gets to acting uneasylike it&#8217;ll be the
signal for me to start shootin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;understand?&#8221; came
the holdup&#8217;s menacing voice as he moved around
behind the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open both cash drawers,&#8221; he ordered the servitor
in the white apron. He covered the bartender with
one gun while he kept the other pointed in the
direction of the men standing in line.</p>
<p>Obeying instructions, the bartender took the bills
from the cash drawers and laid them before the
bandit on the bar. He then made several piles of
silver near the bills, walking to and from the drawers
of the big cash register. Continuing to do as he
was told, he stuffed the bank notes and silver into
the masked man&#8217;s pockets, one gun&#8217;s muzzle against
his breast, the other holding the men in line at bay.</p>
<p>Rathburn heard footsteps on the walk close to
him. He whirled and saw two men about to enter
the resort. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go in there,&#8221; he said sharply
in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men paused, looking at him questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go in there,&#8221; Rathburn repeated.
&#8220;Come here an&#8217; take a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the men stepped to his side and peered
curiously through the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill!&#8221; he whispered excitedly. &#8220;Look here. It&#8217;s
a holdup!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man looked over his shoulder. He swore
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s The Coyote!&#8221; said the first man
in an awed voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Probably is,&#8221; said Rathburn sneeringly. &#8220;They
say he was heading this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good place to stay out of&ndash;&ndash;if it&#8217;s <i>him</i>,&#8221; declared
the second man.</p>
<p>Rathburn suddenly pulled back his left sleeve. &#8220;See
that?&#8221; he said, pointing to his left forearm.</p>
<p>The two men stared at the bared forearm in the
yellow light which shone through the dust-stained
window. They saw a scar about three inches below
the elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a bullet made that,&#8221; one of the men
observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Rathburn, letting down his
shirt sleeve. &#8220;A bullet from The Coyote&#8217;s gun left
that mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men looked at him wonderingly and respectfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys live here?&#8221; asked Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;We work in the Pine
Knot Hotel an&#8217; stables. You from the hills?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; answered Rathburn. &#8220;Cow-puncher an&#8217;
horseshoer an&#8217; one thing an&#8217; another. What&#8217;s he
doing now?&#8221; He again turned his attention to the
scene within the resort, as did the two men with
him.</p>
<p>The bandit was backing away from the bar toward
the rear of the room, still keeping his guns
thrust out before him, menacing the men who stood
with uplifted hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell your funny judge that I called!&#8221;
he sang out as he reached the rear door. &#8220;An&#8217; now,
gents,&#8221; he continued in an excited voice, &#8220;it won&#8217;t
go well with the man that tries to get out this back
way too soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he ceased speaking his guns roared. The
two large hanging lamps, suspended from the ceiling
in the center, went out to the accompaniment of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
shattered glass crashing on the floor. The three
smaller lamps above the back bar next were cut to
splinters by bullets and the place was in total darkness.</p>
<p>Then there was silence, save for the sound of
a horse&#8217;s hoofs coming from somewhere behind the
building.</p>
<p>Rathburn drew back from the window as a match
flared within and his two companions moved toward
the front door. He stole around the corner of the
building and started on a run for the rear. He
stopped when he heard a horse galloping toward the
east end of the street behind the buildings which
lined that side. He hurried behind two buildings
which did not extend as far as the resort and
hastened up the street. He did not once look back.</p>
<p>Behind him he heard shouts and men running in
the street. He increased his pace until he was
running swiftly for the trees where he had left his
horse. From above he caught the dying echoes of
hoofs flying on the trail up the foothills by which
he had come early that night.</p>
<p>The cries down the street increased, a gun barked,
and bullets whined over his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The locoed fools!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t they hear
that fellow ride away?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the shooting evidently was of a promiscuous
nature, for he heard more shots around by the rear
of the place where the robbery had been committed.
No more bullets were fired in his direction as he
darted into the black shadows of the trees.</p>
<p>He quickly untied his horse, mounted, rode in
the shelter of the timber to the east trail, and began
the ascent, urging his horse to its fastest walking
gait up the hard trail. The fleeing bandit&#8217;s sounds
of retreat no longer came to his ears, but he kept
on, scanning the open stretches of trail above in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the starlight, a disparaging smile playing upon his
lips.</p>
<p>Back in the little town excitement was at a high
pitch. Extra lamps had been lighted in the resort
where a big crowd had gathered. Several men ran
to the office of Judson Brown, justice of the peace,
while others went in search of the constable.</p>
<p>When Brown failed to answer the summons at
his door, some one discovered it was not locked,
and the little group of men trooped in to find the
justice gagged and handcuffed to his bed. They
lighted the lamp and removed the gag. Then acting
upon his instructions they took a bunch of keys
from his pocket and unlocked the handcuffs.</p>
<p>He stood, boiling with rage, while they alternately
hurled questions at him and told him of the holdup.</p>
<p>He ignored their questions as to how he came
to be bound and gagged and demanded more details
of the robbery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took him to be The Coyote,&#8221; said the spokesman
of the group. He had been one of the men
the bandit had lined up. &#8220;He was tall, an&#8217; blue or
gray eyes, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A puncher from up north picked him out through
the window,&#8221; spoke up one of the men who had
encountered Rathburn outside the resort. &#8220;He&#8217;d
been shot in the forearm by him once&ndash;&ndash;showed us
the scar. The robber was The Coyote, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly it was him!&#8221; roared Brown. &#8220;He
came in here, tied me up after pulling a gun on
me, an&#8217; threatening to kill me, practically, so he
wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble pulling his trick. Tried
to steer me off by saying he didn&#8217;t come here to
make any trouble. I knew he lied!&#8221;</p>
<p>The constable came in as the justice was finishing
his irate speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to lead this chase myself!&#8221; cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Brown. &#8220;I want The Coyote, and I&#8217;m going to
get him. I raise that reward to a thousand on the
spot, and I know the sheriff will back me up. Get
out every man in town that can stick on a horse,
and we&#8217;ll catch him if we have to comb the hills
and desert country till doomsday!&#8221;</p>
<p>Already horsemen were gathering in the street outside.
Feeling was high, for Dry Lake prided itself
on its record of freedom from the molestation of
outlaws. The rough element, too, was strong for
a man hunt, or anything, for that matter, promising
excitement.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later Brown, who was accepted
as the leader when emergencies involving the
law arose, distributed his forces. He sent two
posses of twenty men each north and northwest.
A third posse of a dozen men started southward.
Towns to the west were notified by telephone as
was the sheriff&#8217;s office. The sheriff said he would
be on his way to Dry Lake in an hour. He was
amazed that The Coyote should be in his territory.
He, too, wanted the outlaw, and he praised Brown
for his reward offer.</p>
<p>Judson Brown himself led the posse of thirty men
which took the east trail up the foothills. It was
an hour past midnight. The moon had risen and
was flooding the tumbled landscape with its cold,
white light. From different vantage points on ridges
high above, two men looked grimly down and saw
the moving shadows of the man hunters as they
took the trail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A CAPTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>Three hours after the posses scattered on their
search for The Coyote, spurred by thoughts of
the reward of a thousand dollars offered by San
Jacinto county, and Judson Brown&#8217;s declaration that
the reward would be increased by the thousands more
which Arizona had laid upon the fugitive&#8217;s head,
Rathburn smiled at the rosy dawn in supreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>He had not lost his man&#8217;s trail during the early
morning hours. Time and again he had outwitted
the man ahead when the latter had waited to scan
the back trail for signs of pursuit; more than once
he had gained ground when screened by timber
growth close to the trail; every stretch of dust-filled
trail had been taken advantage of, while the
soft going underfoot had deadened the sound of
his horse&#8217;s flying hoofs.</p>
<p>The bandit had traveled fast and he had kept
steadily to the eastward. This last was what caused
Rathburn to smile with satisfaction. The man for
whose crime Rathburn was suspected was heading
straight for Rathburn&#8217;s own stamping ground&ndash;&ndash;the
far-distant desert range, which he knew from the
low horizon in the south to the white-capped peaks
in the north. To catch up with him would be but
a matter of a few hours, Rathburn reflected contentedly.</p>
<p>Nor had the posse gained upon the two men ahead.
Brown&#8217;s men, perhaps, did not have as excellent
specimens of horseflesh as Rathburn and his quarry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
rode. Nor did they possess the trail knowledge,
the tricks which Rathburn knew, and which the latter,
more or less to his surprise, found that the
man ahead knew. Whatever it was that caused that
curling, sneering smile of contempt to play upon
Rathburn&#8217;s lips at intervals, it was not scorn of the
riding ability of the man he was pursuing.</p>
<p>Moreover, both men ahead were saving their
horses&#8217; strength against a probable spurt by the posse
at daylight. It would not be a hard matter to follow
their trail by the bright light of broad day. So far
as he could determine, Rathburn did not believe the
man ahead knew he was followed by a solitary rider
who was between him and the hounds of the law.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, the bandit would expect
to be pursued by a number, Rathburn reasoned. He
was ordering his pursuit on this theory, and he did
not intend to take any more time than was absolutely
necessary in catching up with the man ahead.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s horse had not been hard ridden the day
preceding, nor for several days before that. He had
journeyed westward by easy stages, taking his time,
favoring his mount in anticipation of some unforeseen
emergency which might require hard riding.
And he well knew the extraordinary powers of speed
and endurance which the animal possessed.</p>
<p>He frowned as he thought of the brand. He had
not been under the impression that the iron his horse
wore was generally known to the authorities. He
would have to hole-up somewhere in the hills before
long and attend to that brand. As it was, it was a
dead give-away as to his identity. He could thank
Brown for this bit of information, anyway.</p>
<p>With the dawn, Rathburn found it easier to keep
on his man&#8217;s trail without being seen himself. He
gained considerable until he estimated that he was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
more than a mile and a half, or two miles at most,
behind.</p>
<p>The sun was up when he reached the crest of the
high ridge where was the tall pine and the sign which
he had first seen the afternoon before.</p>
<p>He hesitated, debating whether to let the printed
notice remain with his penciled inscription about the
Arizona reward on it, or to tear it down. Then he
saw the man he was pursuing below on the trail.
He moved swiftly out of sight down the eastern side
of the ridge. But when he came to the next vantage
point he discovered that his man had apparently seen
him; for he was riding at a mad gallop on the trail
which wound eastward along the edge of the hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s as good a time as any, hoss!&#8221; he cried to
his mount as he drove in his spurs and dashed in
swift pursuit.</p>
<p>Down the winding trail plunged horse and rider.
The dun slipped and slid on the hard surface of the
steep declivities and finally emerged upon the more
open path which the man ahead was following.</p>
<p>Rathburn no longer made any attempt at concealment.
He was after the man ahead, and, somewhere
behind, a posse was in mad pursuit. If he were captured
before he could overtake the bandit who was
responsible for the robbery, the latter would very
likely escape&ndash;&ndash;was certain to make his get-away, in
fact.</p>
<p>Rathburn called upon his horse by voice and spur
for all the speed there was in him. He could see the
fugitive ahead urging his horse to its utmost. The
race was on in earnest. Thus they came to a long
stretch of open, level trail. Here Rathburn&#8217;s horse
began slowly to gain.</p>
<p>The man ahead turned in his saddle, and Rathburn
saw the glint of sunlight on dull metal. He brought
out his own gun. But the other did not fire. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
kept on, half-turned in the saddle, watching his pursuer
keenly. Rathburn continued to gain upon him.</p>
<p>They now were less than half a mile apart, and
the fugitive suddenly turned his horse due north,
straight toward the hills, and sent a volley of shots
whistling in his pursuer&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>Rathburn held his fire. The bullets flew wide of
their mark, and he could see his man reloading as he
rode. Rathburn now cut across, racing for the point
where he thought the other would reach the hills.
His horse rose to the emergency with a tremendous
burst of speed. He was close enough now to shoot
with a reasonable certainty of scoring a hit on his
flying target. But he had no desire to kill, and he
could not be certain, at that distance, of merely
wounding his quarry. He also recoiled from the
thought that he might accidently hit the other&#8217;s splendid
horse.</p>
<p>Just ahead a thin line of straggling pines ranged
down the gradual slope from the first low ridge of
the hills for which they were heading. Rathburn
swung north and gained the shelter of this screen
just as the other rider again began firing. The trees
now were between them, and each was an equal distance
from the gentle slope of the ridge.</p>
<p>Rathburn called upon his horse for a last, heartbreaking
burst of speed and the dun made good.
At the beginning of the slope to the ridge, Rathburn
veered sharply to the right and burst through the
trees a scant rod or two from his man. His gun
was leveled straight at the other, who had been caught
momentarily off his guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop it!&#8221; shouted Rathburn, racing toward him.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s right hand fell to his side while he
checked his horse with his left. Rathburn rode in
close to him and they came to a halt. Rathburn&#8217;s lips
were curled in a smile of contempt. The other stared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
at him, white-faced, his eyes wide and inquiring.
The fingers of his right hand relaxed, and the gun
fell to the ground. Rathburn swung low in the
saddle and scooped it up, thrusting it into a pocket of
his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now beat it up over that ridge ahead,&#8221; Rathburn
ordered. &#8220;And be quick about it. That posse may
be close behind us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s eyes lit up with surprise. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re
not an officer?&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, you fool!&#8221; cried Rathburn. &#8220;You want
to stay here an&#8217; talk when there&#8217;s a score or two of
men after us? I&#8217;m worse than an officer. Slope for
that ridge now. Hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man put the steel to his horse, and they dashed
up the slope, crossed the ridge, and found themselves
in a thick growth of timber which covered a large
area.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick your way into the middle of that patch of
timber,&#8221; snapped out Rathburn. &#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217;t forget
I&#8217;ll be right close behind you. Get going&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
gape!&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive&#8217;s face flushed at the other&#8217;s manner
and the indubitable note of contempt in his voice.
But he obeyed the instructions and pushed into the
timber.</p>
<p>When they had proceeded some distance Rathburn
called a halt. &#8220;Ever been in this country before?&#8221;
he demanded with a sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The other was more composed now. He
studied his captor curiously and seemed more at ease.
Evidently he was heartened by the fact that Rathburn
had said he was not an officer and he believed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re after what I&#8217;m carrying on me,&#8221;
he said with a touch of bitterness. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;d have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
had as much chance as I&#8217;ve got now if I&#8217;d started
shootin&#8217; even after you got the drop on me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed harshly. &#8220;You never had a
chance from the start, if you only knew it,&#8221; he
jeered. &#8220;Why, you upstart, you&#8217;re not entitled to
any chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man&#8217;s face darkened in swift anger.
&#8220;Brave talk,&#8221; he said sneeringly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got me
where you want me, so you can say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a pile to say,&#8221; replied Rathburn shortly.
&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t the time or place to say it. We want
to be good an&#8217; away out of that posse&#8217;s path&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might as well take what you&#8217;re after an&#8217; then
each of us can look out for himself,&#8221; was the hot
retort.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked at the man quizzically. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got more spunk than I thought,&#8221; he mused.</p>
<p>He stared at the other man closely. The bandit
could not have been more than twenty-five or twenty-six.
He was tall, well-built, blond. His hair and
eyes were about the color of Rathburn&#8217;s. But Rathburn
particularly noted the man&#8217;s face, and whatever
it was he saw there caused him to shrug and frown
deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; he demanded coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Percy,&#8221; sneeringly replied the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good enough for me,&#8221; said Rathburn
cheerfully. &#8220;All I need is a name to call you by.
Now, Percy, if you&#8217;re acquainted with this country
in here an&#8217; can steer the way to where the posse&#8217;ll
be liable to overlook us you better be leading on. I
see you&#8217;ve ditched your other gun somewhere&ndash;&ndash;you
had two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you want me to take you where you&#8217;ll be
safe so you can rob me, maybe shoot me down, an&#8217;
then make your get-away,&#8221; the other accused.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>Rathburn looked him straight in the eyes. &#8220;If
you think I&#8217;m the kind of a man who&#8217;d shoot another
down in cold blood when he was helpless you don&#8217;t
know much about human beings,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;I
have no intention of murdering you or harming you
a-tall, if you&#8217;re halfway careful. If you feel that it&#8217;s
against your principles to lead this expedition to
temporary safety, we can turn back toward Dry
Lake. We&#8217;re going to do one thing or the other
within one minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come on,&#8221; muttered the captive. He led the
way through the timber to its western edge, then
turned north in the shelter of the trees traversing a
long, high, rocky ridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our horses won&#8217;t leave any tracks here,&#8221; he
called back. &#8220;Or maybe you don&#8217;t care whether we
leave any tracks or not,&#8221; he added sarcastically.</p>
<p>Rathburn spurred his horse alongside of him. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t make a bit of difference to me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the one that&#8217;s got to be scared of that posse,
Percy, not me. If it wasn&#8217;t for one thing I&#8217;d take
you right down there to meet &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other looked at him both in anger and perplexity.
&#8220;Suppose you&#8217;d object to tellin&#8217; what that
one thing is,&#8221; he said savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it may be that I feel sorry for you,&#8221; said
Rathburn as if to himself. &#8220;An&#8217; it may be that I
want credit for bringing you in without the help of
any posse an&#8217; without them knowing it!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE REAL LOW-DOWN</h3>
</div>
<p>They rode on in silence. When they reached the
north end of the ridge the man in the lead turned
west on a slope studded with large boulders and rock
outcroppings. There was considerable shale here,
too, and they had to proceed cautiously in spots,
both for fear of sliding down the shale and to prevent
making much noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they follow us up here, we can hear &#8217;em before
they get to us,&#8221; said the man who called himself
Percy, with a shrug and a frowning look at his
companion.</p>
<p>Rathburn did not reply.</p>
<p>They continued across the slope and descended
into a large bowl or pocket, guarded by huge boulders
and scattering trees on the slope above.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it&#8217;s safe to rest our horses here,&#8221; said
Percy. &#8220;We can hear &#8217;em coming either way; but
I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll get up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, neither he nor Rathburn knew how many
men Brown had at his command, nor did they know
that the sheriff of the county, with two deputies, had
raced to Dry Lake by automobile, procured horses,
and hastened to join Brown on the east trail, which
seemed the most likely route of escape for the outlaw.</p>
<p>There was a spring in the pocket surrounded by a
small meadow of good grass. The pair watered
their horses, loosened their saddle-cinches, and permitted
the animals to graze with reins dangling.</p>
<p>Rathburn took his slicker pack from the rear of
his saddle and spread it open on the ground.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Reckon it&#8217;s safe to build a small fire here?&#8221; he
asked cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m powerful hungry, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
got some emergency provisions&ndash;&ndash;being trail-broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Percy, too, was hungry, as his eager look toward
the pack testified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll climb up to the top on the lower side an&#8217;
keep an eye out while you fix some grub,&#8221; he volunteered.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be scared of me jumping over
the other side. There&#8217;s a drop of about five hundred
feet over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead and jump if you want,&#8221; said Rathburn.
&#8220;Me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d rather live. That&#8217;s why I want to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the other climbed to his lookout position
Rathburn made a fire. Then he took a small frying
pan and coffeepot, minus its handle, from the pack,
removed the packages stuffed in them, and soon was
making coffee, frying bacon, and warming up beans.
This, with some hard biscuits and some sirup out of
a bottle, constituted their meal, which Rathburn soon
had ready.</p>
<p>Again he looked closely at Percy&#8217;s face as the
latter scrambled down from his perch to appease his
hunger.</p>
<p>Suddenly he burst out laughing; but it was a belittling
laugh, half sneering, which brought the
blood to the face of the captive while Rathburn
watched him closely.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had to-day&#8217;s actions to do over again you
mightn&#8217;t be so tickled,&#8221; said the man viciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m laughing to think how lucky you are for a
rank beginner an&#8217; botcher!&#8221; said Rathburn as they
began to eat. &#8220;You must have took a course in outlawing
from some correspondence school,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you could have done better,&#8221; hinted the
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite likely I could,&#8221; admitted Rathburn. &#8220;In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the first place I&#8217;d have shut that back door after I
came in so nobody could pot shot me from behind.
Yes, I reckon I&#8217;d have done that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Percy glared at him thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wouldn&#8217;t have let myself get in line with
the front and side windows,&#8221; Rathburn taunted.
&#8220;Lots of men are shot through windows. Ever hear
of such a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>His listener didn&#8217;t answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now that I think of it,&#8221; Rathburn droned
on, &#8220;I&#8217;d have lined those men up against the wall
with their faces turned away from me. That puts
&#8217;em at more of a disadvantage, an&#8217; they can&#8217;t see
what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Percy now was regarding him keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Rathburn, with tantalizing slowness.
&#8220;Oh, yes, Percy. I wouldn&#8217;t have taken anything
from the cash drawers but the bills. I don&#8217;t
like to take the time to monkey around with a lot
of silver; besides, it sort of weights one down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused long enough to let that sink in, then
continued: &#8220;The thing I&#8217;d have paid most of my
attention to&ndash;&ndash;excepting for keeping a watchful eye
on the men against the wall an&#8217; the windows an&#8217;
doors&ndash;&ndash;would have been the safe. The big money&#8217;s
usually in the safe, an&#8217; the bartender can be induced
to open the safe just as easy as he can be persuaded
into opening the cash drawers. An&#8217; say, Percy, I&#8217;d
never let a bartender get as close to me as you let
that fellow get to you. He might start something,
then you&#8217;d have to begin shootin&#8217; an&#8217; that would
alarm the town an&#8217; ball up the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like you&#8217;d had considerable experience,&#8221;
observed Percy warily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. Maybe I have. But if I have, I can
say I&#8217;ve never pulled anything quite so raw as the
way you pulled that stunt last night down in Dry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Lake, Percy. That is the real low-down on that.
You just naturally laid yourself open to attack from
all quarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>His captive looked at him both respectfully and
sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; there&#8217;s only one reason why you got away
with it,&#8221; said Rathburn, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I was lucky like you say, I suppose,&#8221;
sneeringly answered Percy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; thundered Rathburn. &#8220;You got away with
it because they thought you were The Coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive started; stared at Rathburn with
widened eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you got away with it,&#8221; continued
Rathburn in a hard voice. &#8220;An&#8217; you thought you&#8217;d
cinch it when you told &#8217;em before you went out
that they could tell their funny judge you called!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes blazed with angry contempt.
&#8220;Trading on somebody else&#8217;s name,&#8221; he mocked.
&#8220;Trying to make out you was the goods, an&#8217; I believe
they thought you was The Coyote, at that.
Man, I saw the whole dirty business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Percy&#8217;s face went white. However, his emotion
was more anger than fear, and he was prey to an
overpowering curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I <i>ain&#8217;t</i> The Coyote?&#8221; he asked
shrewdly.</p>
<p>Rathburn stared at him&ndash;&ndash;stunned. Then he leaped
to his feet and his gun flashed into his hand in a
movement too swift for the eye to follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go over there and look at the brand on my horse,&#8221;
he commanded. &#8220;Remember how that printed bill
read that put it in your fool head to try an&#8217; masquerade
as The Coyote, an&#8217; then read the brand on that
horse!&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive rose and without a look back walked
to where Rathburn&#8217;s horse was cropping the grass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
The left side of the animal was toward him and for
a few moments he stood looking with bulging eyes
at the CC2 on the shoulder. Then he turned slowly.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s gaze burned into his, but a cool, deliberate
light had come into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re The Coyote!&#8221; Percy said quietly. &#8220;I
should have recognized you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m called The Coyote,&#8221; said Rathburn,
walking slowly toward him. &#8220;I&#8217;m the man they
think robbed that joint down in Dry Lake last night.
I&#8217;m the man they&#8217;re looking for. I&#8217;m the man they
want to make pay for your bungling work. That&#8217;s
the way it&#8217;s gone for three years, Percy. I&#8217;ve been
blamed for job after job that I didn&#8217;t even know
was pulled off till I heard they were looking for me
on account of it. But this is one job they&#8217;ll not be
able to lay at my door; for I&#8217;ve got the man who&#8217;s
responsible an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got him red-handed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re you going to do about it?&#8221; asked the
other coolly.</p>
<p>Again Rathburn&#8217;s eyes blazed with rage. &#8220;Do?
Why, I&#8217;m just naturally going to take you in all
by my lonesome an&#8217; turn you over to the sheriff
with my compliments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn cooled down as he said this, drew
tobacco and papers from his shirt pocket, and proceeded
to build a cigarette. He looked at his man
queerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I reckon you know why I ain&#8217;t got any
idea of taking that money off you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might not believe you,&#8221; returned the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean. You mean they might
think I was putting up a job on &#8217;em an&#8217; trying
to shift the blame on somebody else. It can&#8217;t be
done, Percy. Listen to this: I was looking through
the front window of that place last night when you
held it up. Two men that work in the hotel down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
there came along an&#8217; looked in alongside of me
after I warned &#8217;em not to go in. I showed &#8217;em this
scar on my arm.&#8221; He rolled back his left sleeve
disclosing a scar on the forearm about three inches
below the elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told &#8217;em that scar was made by a bullet from
The Coyote&#8217;s gun,&#8221; Rathburn went on, pulling down
his sleeve and drawing his right hand back to the
gun he had replaced in its holster. &#8220;That scar
<i>was</i> made by The Coyote&#8217;s gun. I shot myself in
the arm by accident some few years ago. Now,
here&#8217;s the point: Those men will remember me an&#8217;
remember that scar. The descriptions the sheriff
of that county must have in his office will tell
all about that scar. It won&#8217;t be hard to identify
me by it an&#8217; by the two men that stood out there
by the window with me. So they&#8217;ll know I didn&#8217;t
pull the robbery!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man shifted uneasily on his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that ain&#8217;t all, Percy,&#8221; Rathburn continued.
&#8220;Somebody saw me running up the street afterward
because they took a couple of shots at me for
luck. That&#8217;ll dovetail with my story. I&#8217;ve never
been known to use two guns. An&#8217; if they want
any more proof all they&#8217;ll have to do will be to
stand you up in front of the men you had in line,
dressed as you are with that black handkerchief
over your face. That&#8217;ll settle it. I reckon the
sheriff will believe me an&#8217; give me a chance when
he hears the facts, or I may not wait for a talk
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I take it you&#8217;ve got me right,&#8221; said the captive,
compressing his lips. &#8220;But if you&#8217;re really The
Coyote I&#8217;ve heard so much about, you&#8217;ll give me
my gun an&#8217; give me a chance to run for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s laugh jarred on his ears. &#8220;Give you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
a chance an&#8217; take a chance myself on going to the
gallows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The gallows!&#8221; exclaimed the other. &#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;I see.
But didn&#8217;t you say you thought the sheriff would
give you a chance if he met you an&#8217; heard your
story? At that you don&#8217;t have to stay around
an&#8217; get taken back to Arizona now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They hang men in this State,&#8221; Rathburn interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;there wasn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The other man faltered,
staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those shots you fired at the lamp went
wild, or glanced off something, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Rathburn
lifted his brows significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed somebody!&#8221; cried the other.</p>
<p>He staggered back just as a rattle of falling
stones signified that horsemen were in the shale on
the slope to eastward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>WHERE TO HIDE</h3>
</div>
<p>For the space of several seconds Rathburn and
his captive looked into each other&#8217;s eyes. Rathburn&#8217;s
gaze was keen, alert, fired by the quick
thinking he was doing. Stark terror showed in
the other&#8217;s look which gradually changed to one
of haunting fear and indecision. Then his eyes
became clear and he returned Rathburn&#8217;s glance,
cool and questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your horse,&#8221; ordered Rathburn, running to
his own mount.</p>
<p>In a twinkling he had tightened his cinch, caught
up the reins, and vaulted into the saddle. His
captive was at his side shortly afterward.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still in the lead,&#8221; Rathburn snapped out;
&#8220;unless you want to wait for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other whirled his horse, sent him flying for
the western end of the pocket, with Rathburn close
behind. They went up a steep, rocky trail, screened
by boulders. When they reached the top of the
west rim they looked back and saw four horsemen
on the shale slope leading to the pocket. Brown
evidently had split up his posse and was literally
combing the hills for his quarry.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll know they&#8217;re on the right trail when
they see the remains of our dinner an&#8217; my pack
down there,&#8221; remarked Rathburn dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they haven&#8217;t seen us yet,&#8221; said Percy breathlessly.
&#8220;If we can make Sunrise Ca&ntilde;on Trail we
can lose &#8217;em in the mountains&ndash;&ndash;that is if <i>you</i> want
to lose &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the trail?&#8221; asked Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout five miles west. It&#8217;s the only trail goin&#8217;
up into the big mountains between here an&#8217; the
other side of the Dry Lake range, an&#8217; it&#8217;s a tough
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn quickly sized up the country ahead. He
saw low and high ridges with towering mountains
to the right, or north, of them. There were scattering
pines on the slopes and patches of timber in
the wide ravines, many of which were veritable
valleys.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll run for it while they&#8217;re getting in an&#8217;
out of that hole,&#8221; he suddenly decided with a click
of his teeth. &#8220;Their horses are in no better shape
than ours. Slope along.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other had dug in his spurs even before he
got the order. They rode swiftly down the steep
trail from the rim of the pocket and fled across
an open space and up the slope of the first ridge.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked back as they crossed it, but
could see no sign of their pursuers. His face
still was troubled; his gaze kept boring into the
back of the man on the horse ahead of him. At
times he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>They galloped up the hard bed of a dry arroyo
and swung westward across another rock-bound
ridge, picking their way carefully among the boulders.
Rathburn&#8217;s face became more and more strained as
he noted that the leader evidently knew the country
they were in like a book. Rathburn, with the experience
born of years spent in the open places,
was able to keep his bearings.</p>
<p>They had followed a course for some miles north
of the main trail leading east, the trail by which
he had first come into the locality. Then they had
doubled back westward, some miles above that
trail, of course, and now were heading almost due
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
north again, in the direction of the mountains which
did not appear to be far away. He surmised that
they were nearly directly north of the ranch where
he had had the meal with the girl and boy.</p>
<p>At the top of the next ridge his guide pointed
above them.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that crack in the mountain?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded as he made out what appeared
to be a gash in the steep side of a mountain north
of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Sunrise Ca&ntilde;on,&#8221; said the other quietly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a trail up that ca&ntilde;on into the heart of the
mountains where they couldn&#8217;t catch us&ndash;&ndash;or you, if
you want to go alone&ndash;&ndash;in a hundred years!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared steadily at Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mosey along, then,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
somewheres before our horses drop.&#8221;</p>
<p>They kept along the ridge until it was cut by a
ca&ntilde;on. Here they descended and entered another
long, narrow ravine which they negotiated at a
gallop. At its upper end they again climbed a steep
slope. Their horses were showing the strain of
the hours of hard riding. Rathburn realized that
they could go but a limited distance. But the
members of the posse most assuredly must be in
the same fix so far as their mounts were concerned.</p>
<p>He decided that if they could get into the ca&ntilde;on
unseen they would be able to rest their horses and
remain secure for the night. Next morning
they could continue on up into the hills, or slip back
by a roundabout way to Dry Lake.</p>
<p>His lips froze into a thin white line. He did
not look at the man with him as they paused for
a few moments under the trees which covered the
top of the ridge and gazed at a long, gently sloping
stretch of nearly open country. It was covered
with clumps of trees at intervals, that reached to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
the dark, narrow opening in the mountains, marking
the entrance to Sunrise Ca&ntilde;on and the trail
to the fastnesses of the higher hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can swing off here to the left an&#8217; down a
wide valley to where there&#8217;s a cut-off into Dry
Lake,&#8221; he heard his captive suggesting. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see any sense in all this hard ridin&#8217; an&#8217; hidin&#8217;
if you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to turn me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go on,&#8221; growlingly replied Rathburn.</p>
<p>They descended the ridge and entered the long,
sloping valley, so wide that it virtually was a plain.
They made good headway, although they favored
their horses. They took advantage of the shelter
provided by the occasional clumps of pines. The
afternoon was drawing to a close with the sun
dipping sharply toward the western hills when they
came in sight of the entrance to the ca&ntilde;on. But
with the first glimpse they checked their horses
and turned into the shelter of some trees near by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beat us to it!&#8221; exclaimed Percy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four of &#8217;em,&#8221; said Rathburn, frowning. &#8220;Brown
ain&#8217;t taking any chances. He&#8217;s a better man than
I figured him out. An&#8217; there&#8217;s more of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed westward where two riders were barely
discernible on the crest of a ridge. They disappeared
almost immediately in the timber below.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll turn back,&#8221; Rathburn decided. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
ride with the trees between us an&#8217; the men up at
the ca&ntilde;on, an&#8217; keep an eye out for the pair to the
west. You might watch that side, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll look out
for the east an&#8217; south. C&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s drift.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of the man who called himself Percy was
white and strained as they urged their tired mounts
southward. They skirted the western end of the
ridge by which they had gained the wide valley
and continued on, carefully scanning the landscape
in all directions for indications of pursuit. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
plain to them that they had been seen to leave
the east trail early that morning. Brown and his
men undoubtedly knew they had headed north, and
the justice had immediately dispatched men to guard
the entrance to the ca&ntilde;on trail into the mountains.
Then they had begun a systematic search of the
locality.</p>
<p>This deduction was strengthened when Rathburn
suddenly pointed toward the east. More riders were
to be seen on the slope of the valley&#8217;s side in that
direction. Even as they looked, these riders, too,
disappeared from view as they dropped down behind
a rise of ground.</p>
<p>The sun was going down fast. Already the red
banners of the sunset were flaunted in the high
western skies. The twilight would be upon them
apace&ndash;&ndash;the long-lasting, purple-veiled twilight of the
altitudes. Then the night would close down with
its canopy of stars.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked speculatively at his companion.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make a break for that clump of trees about
a quarter of a mile ahead with all our horses have
got left,&#8221; he said, driving in his spurs.</p>
<p>In a last mad dash which taxed every iota of
strength and endurance left in their beasts they
gained the shelter of the little patch of timber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; said Rathburn coolly as he
dismounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried the other, staring at him incredulously.
&#8220;We ain&#8217;t quite surrounded yet. We
haven&#8217;t seen anybody in the south. That way may
be open an&#8217; it&#8217;s liable to be closed while we&#8217;re stayin&#8217;
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get off your horse and unsaddle him,&#8221; commanded
Rathburn sternly. &#8220;The best place to hide
from a posse is in the middle of it!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>TWO QUEER MOVES</h3>
</div>
<p>The captive complied with the order, looking
at Rathburn in a peculiar way&ndash;&ndash;half disgusted,
half contemptuous. Indeed, he turned his back on
the other, leaned against the slender trunk of a
pine, and stared steadily into the south. He appeared
much worried.</p>
<p>The horses welcomed the chance to rest.</p>
<p>Rathburn walked slowly back and forth the width
of the patch of timber, vigilantly keeping watch.
He paid no attention whatsoever to the man leaning
against the tree. For all the interest he displayed
he might have completely forgotten his very existence.
In time this got on the other&#8217;s nerves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you lied when you said there was a
man killed down there last night,&#8221; he said coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anybody was killed,&#8221; Rathburn returned
without looking in his direction. &#8220;You assumed
that part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you wanted me to think so,&#8221; said the other
in a loud voice. &#8220;You was tryin&#8217; to throw a scare
into me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn swung on his heel and stepped squarely
in front of him. &#8220;I let you think that to show
you what <i>might</i> have happened,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Such
things have happened to me an&#8217; swelled the price
on my head. Now, darn you, if you talk that
loud again I&#8217;ll choke your wind off!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words came with sinister earnestness, but
they seemed to rouse some dormant strain of extraordinary
courage in the man to whom they were
addressed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>He suddenly leaped from the tree and struck out
with all the force at his command.</p>
<p>But Rathburn had anticipated the attack. He
knocked the other&#8217;s blow aside and drove his right
straight to the jaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a little souvenir to show you that I
mean business, Percy,&#8221; he panted.</p>
<p>Percy came back to the attack with eyes gleaming
with malice. Again he attempted to hit Rathburn,
but the latter stepped aside with lightning swiftness
and drove home another blow. He followed it up
with a left and right and Percy sprawled his length
on the grass.</p>
<p>After a time he sat up, dazed. Rathburn was
standing over him. But although he realized fully
that he was not a match for Rathburn in physical
combat, and doubtless was greatly his inferior with
his gun, his spirit was undaunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better finish me, or drag me in,&#8221; he gritted;
&#8220;for I&#8217;ll get you, if I can. I don&#8217;t know what
your play is, but you&#8217;ve acted too queer to-day
for me to believe you&#8217;re on the square one way
or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want some more, Percy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Lamy,&#8221; growlingly replied the other,
as he rose cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, o-h. Percy Lamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, just Lamy. Lamy&#8217;s my name, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t
ashamed of it. You&#8217;d find it out&ndash;&ndash;sooner or later&ndash;&ndash;anyway,
I&ndash;&ndash;expect.&#8221; He stammered during this
speech as if he had just remembered something&ndash;&ndash;remembered
when it was too late.</p>
<p>Rathburn noted the frown and the confused
expression in Lamy&#8217;s eyes. He turned abruptly
and walked away.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he came back to find Lamy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
sitting with his back to a tree, staring unseeing
into the deepening twilight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lamy,&#8221; he said harshly, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to get
away from this posse&ndash;&ndash;maybe. Anyway, soon&#8217;s it&#8217;s
dark we&#8217;ll ride south. It&#8217;s just possible we can
leave &#8217;em up here in the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I refuse to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have to truss you up an&#8217; tie you to
your horse, an&#8217; don&#8217;t think I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221; The
ring of menace in Rathburn&#8217;s voice convinced the
other, but he made no comment.</p>
<p>When darkness had fallen they saddled their
mounts and started. They rode at a jog, keeping
as much as possible in the shadow of the timber.
Rathburn noticed that the valley gradually widened;
he showed interest in his surroundings.</p>
<p>Then, off to the left below them, he saw moving
shadows. He called a halt at the next clump of
trees. &#8220;Lamy, are there any horses running in
here that you know of?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There probably are,&#8221; said Lamy sarcastically;
&#8220;an&#8217; they&#8217;ve probably got riders on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; returned Rathburn gravely. &#8220;I just
saw some shadows that looked like horses down to
the left of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected they&#8217;d shut us off in the south,&#8221;
snapped out Lamy. &#8220;You gave &#8217;em plenty of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We just naturally had to rest our horses,&#8221; observed
Rathburn. &#8220;As it is, they&#8217;re not good for
far, nor for any fast riding. Besides, I&#8217;ve changed
my mind some since this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So? I suppose you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to give me a chance?&#8221;
sneeringly inquired the other.</p>
<p>He could see Rathburn&#8217;s eyes in the twilight,
and suddenly he shifted in his saddle uneasily. For
Rathburn&#8217;s gaze had narrowed; and it shot from
his eyes steel blue with a flash of fire. His face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
had set in cold, grim lines. The whole nature of
the man seemed to undergo a change. He radiated
menace, contempt, cold resentment. The corners
of his mouth twisted down sharply. His voice,
as he spoke now, seemed edged like a knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lamy, hand over that money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy&#8217;s brows lifted in swift comprehension; a
look of cunning came into his eyes&ndash;&ndash;was followed
by a gleam of hope, not unmixed with derision.
He thrust his hands into his coat pockets and held
out bills and silver to Rathburn who stuffed the
plunder into his own pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;That all of it?&#8221; demanded Rathburn sharply.
He made no effort to temper the tones of his
voice.</p>
<p>For answer Lamy dug into his trousers&#8217; pockets,
under his chaps, and produced two more rolls of
bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the chunk,&#8221; he said with a sneering inflection
in his voice. &#8220;If you want I&#8217;ll stand a
frisk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t search you. I take it you&#8217;re too
sensible to lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; replied Lamy dryly. &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m
free to go now, unless you figure you&#8217;d be safer
by killin&#8217; me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anger, swift and uncontrollable, leaped into Rathburn&#8217;s
eyes. Then he laughed, softly and mirthlessly.
&#8220;If I&#8217;d been minded to do for you, or had
any such idea in my head, I&#8217;d have given it to
you long before this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s lucky for
you, Lamy, that I&#8217;m pretty much the breed you
thought I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pose!&#8221; retorted Lamy hotly. &#8220;You intended
to get that money and make me the goat
if you could, from the start. If you&#8217;d had any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
idea of turnin&#8217; me over to Brown you&#8217;d have done
that little thing, too, long before this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; Rathburn mused, staring at the other
thoughtfully in the dim light of the stars. &#8220;Maybe
I will yet. You&#8217;re not out of this&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; neither am I.
Those shadows down to the left are getting plainer.
What&#8217;s that long dark streak over there on the
right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are trees,&#8221; answered Lamy sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make for &#8217;em,&#8221; ordered Rathburn. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget you&#8217;re still under orders, Lamy. An&#8217; don&#8217;t
overlook the fact that I&#8217;m more or less in earnest
about things in general,&#8221; he added significantly.</p>
<p>They rode at a tangent for the dark shadow
of the trees. At the edge of the timber ensued another
long wait, with Rathburn uncommunicative,
moodily pacing restlessly back and forth. The
horses had another excellent opportunity to rest and
the fagged animals took advantage of it.</p>
<p>Once or twice Rathburn thought he glimpsed
a light far down the valley, but he couldn&#8217;t be
sure. Neither could he be sure he saw the moving
shadows on the opposite side of the wide valley
again.</p>
<p>The night wore into early morning and the moon
added its cold radiance to the faint glow of the
myriads of stars. Rathburn sensed the nearness
of enemies. Several times he stopped before Lamy,
who sat upon his saddle blanket with his back against
a tree trunk and dozed. Rathburn had to fight off
continual drowsiness.</p>
<p>For long hours he walked along the edge of the
pines. He dared not trust himself to sleep. He
dared not trust Lamy to stand guard while he
obtained some rest, and he knew that when the
sun came up and the day began, he would be
thoroughly awake again; for more than once he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
gone two nights without sleep. Also, he assumed
that the hunt would be less spirited during the
night. Members of the posse would themselves be
drowsy, but they could spell each other and in that
way maintain their vigil and secure a few hours
of rest.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s rage rose at frequent intervals as he
thought of the predicament he was in through no
fault of his own. More than once he glared
malevolently at the sleeping Lamy; then the troubled
look would come again to his eyes and he would
resume his pacing, muttering to himself, staring into
the blue veil of the night. Once he sat down
and removed his right boot and sock in the darkness;
shortly afterward he again began his pacing.</p>
<p>He felt the pangs of hunger and shook his head
savagely as he thought of the scanty supply of
provisions he had been compelled to leave in the
mountain pocket.</p>
<p>His spirits revived as he thought of the horses.
They would be fresh in the morning; and he intended
that his horse should have a grain feed that
day. Rathburn always thought of his horse first;
and, although it might seem that he taxed the animal&#8217;s
powers to their utmost at times, he never
went beyond a certain point. He had often said
he would surrender to his pursuers rather than kill
his mount in evading them.</p>
<p>The first faint glimmer of the dawn was lighting
the skies above the ridges to the eastward when
he roused Lamy. He awoke with a start, stared
sleepily at Rathburn, then got speedily to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You been awake all night?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded, looking at him closely. &#8220;Saddle
up,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>They rode southward at a canter in the shelter of
the edge of the timber. When the eastern skies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
were rosy red and fast changing to gold with the
advent of the sun they saw two things; a small
ranch house about a mile southeast of them, and
two riders some distance north.</p>
<p>Rathburn reined in his mount. He looked at
Lamy who met his gaze in defiance. Then Rathburn
reached into his coat pocket with his right
hand and drew out a gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your shooting iron,&#8221; he said, as he held
the weapon out to Lamy.</p>
<p>The other stared at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it!&#8221; snapped out Rathburn. &#8220;Take it, or
I may change my mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy took the gun wonderingly, balanced it for
a moment in his hand, and shoved it into his holster.</p>
<p>Rathburn motioned toward the south and Lamy
rode along at his side. They caught another glimpse
of the horsemen in the north. As they drew opposite
the ranch house, on the west or front side,
they saw a woman leave it and walk the short distance
to the barn and enter. At that moment both
Rathburn and Lamy gave vent to low exclamations.
They had caught sight of riders in the south
and to the east. They appeared to be surrounded by
the posse.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked at Lamy soberly. However, it
was Lamy who spoke first. &#8220;You said the best
place to hide from a posse was in the middle of
it,&#8221; he said scornfully. &#8220;Why not leave the horses
in the timber an&#8217; run for the house? Maybe it has
a cellar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that would be as good a move as
any,&#8221; replied Rathburn, to the other&#8217;s surprise. &#8220;I&#8217;m
game if you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy&#8217;s eyes flamed with excitement as he turned
his mount into the trees. They came to what looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
like a bear pit or a prospect hole. It was partly
filled with brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can hide our saddles in there an&#8217; let the
horses go,&#8221; Lamy suggested. &#8220;There&#8217;s a few horses
runnin&#8217; in through here, an&#8217; they may join &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do that with yours,&#8221; said Rathburn
grimly. &#8220;You seem to forget that the brand on
this dun is pretty well known.&#8221;</p>
<p>He coolly tied his horse as Lamy followed his
own suggestion, hid his saddle, and turned his
mount loose.</p>
<p>They moved back to the edge of the timber and
waited until they could see no one in sight about
the house or in any direction in the valley. Then
they started on a run for the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>LEAVE IT TO ME</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn had recognized the ranch long before
they came close to it. It was the place
where he had stopped for a meal with the girl and
the freckle-faced boy two days before&ndash;&ndash;the day he
had gone on into Dry Lake. He saw no sign
of the girl or the boy or any one else as they
reached the front door and hurried inside.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw Lamy look
hurriedly about and step into the kitchen. He
followed him.</p>
<p>Lamy grabbed part of a loaf of bread and some
cold meat on a shelf above the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s usually a cellar under the main room
in these square houses,&#8221; he said, hurrying back into
the larger room.</p>
<p>Rathburn stepped after him, and Lamy pulled
back the rug before the table and disclosed a trapdoor.
He raised the door, held out the food to
Rathburn, and whispered: &#8220;You better get down
there. Take this grub an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Isn&#8217;t there room for both
of us?&#8221; Rathburn put the question in a voice which
conveyed surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it might be better if we&ndash;&ndash;if we didn&#8217;t
both hide in the same place,&#8221; whispered Lamy.
&#8220;Then they&#8217;d only get one of us, an&#8217; whichever it
was they&#8217;d think he was the one they wanted, see?&#8221;
He appeared excited.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes narrowed. His right hand darted
to his gun in a flash, and the muzzle of the weapon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
was pressed into Lamy&#8217;s ribs. &#8220;Get down there!&#8221;
commanded Rathburn. &#8220;Get down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy hesitated with a wild look in his eyes.
The muzzle of Rathburn&#8217;s gun pressed harder against
his midriff. He dropped lightly into the cellar.
Rathburn pulled the rug against the trapdoor as
he followed, then let down the door, certain that
the rug would fall into place.</p>
<p>The pair sat upon some gunny sacks in the little
cellar until their eyes became accustomed to the
darkness; they could dimly see each other by the
faint light which came to them through some cracks
in the floor above.</p>
<p>They heard steps at the rear of the house; then
the pound of hoofs from in front. Rathburn saw
Lamy staring at him fixedly with a puzzled look.
He frowned at him. Rathburn still held his gun
in his hand. Both had forgotten the food which
Lamy had in his lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; whispered Lamy. &#8220;What was your idea
in givin&#8217; me back my gun?&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved closer to get the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said Rathburn, cocking an ear toward
the trapdoor.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps now was in the kitchen.
They heard horses snorting and men dismounting
at the front door. After a brief space there were
light footsteps in the room above followed by the
tramp of heavy boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; came a deep voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; was the hesitating reply. Rathburn
recognized the voice of the girl who had fed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m Sheriff Neal of San Jacinto County,&#8221;
continued the deep voice, as several feet shuffled
slightly. &#8220;These men with me are members of my
posse. Maybe you know Judge Brown?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve seen him,&#8221; answered the girl.</p>
<p>Rathburn could feel Lamy&#8217;s knees shaking against
him in excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we&#8217;ve met some time,&#8221; Brown put in.
Rathburn thought the justice&#8217;s voice sounded tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, we&#8217;re looking for a man&ndash;&ndash;or two men.&#8221;
It was the sheriff speaking again. &#8220;Have you seen
any one around here this morning&ndash;&ndash;any stranger,
or strangers, I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; replied the girl with a breathless
catch in her voice. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn frowned at the sheriff&#8217;s tone, although
he kept his eyes on Lamy&#8217;s white face.</p>
<p>He smiled as he remembered that the sheriff
had mentioned two men. This doubtless was the
cause of Lamy&#8217;s agitation. Nor did he think Lamy
had forgotten that he, Rathburn, had pointed out
that he could prove he didn&#8217;t rob the place in Dry
Lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221; the sheriff asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she can get us some breakfast,&#8221; said
Brown hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you feed five men, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked the
sheriff in a softer tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just sit down, and I&#8217;ll get you some breakfast,&#8221;
said the girl.</p>
<p>The two men in the little cellar could hear some
of the men taking chairs and one or two going
out to look after the horses. The girl&#8217;s light footsteps
retreated into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Rathburn smiled mysteriously at Lamy who was
shivering with a case of nerves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand who that was with him&ndash;&ndash;or
following him,&#8221; came Brown&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Somebody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
must have seen him getting away and set
out on the trail while it was hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either that or saw him beating it somewheres
on the trail east of town an&#8217; took after him on
suspicion,&#8221; drawled the sheriff. &#8220;&#8217;Spect everybody
around here has seen those reward notices you put
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Brown. &#8220;I had the right hunch
when I got the tip he&#8217;d left his Arizona hangout,
sheriff. I figured he&#8217;d head this way. Then he
had the nerve&ndash;&ndash;well, you know what happened in
my office.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff chuckled. Then he spoke angrily.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t pull any of his stunts in my territory,&#8221;
he said growlingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hunt him down if I have
to put every man I&#8217;ve got on the trail an&#8217; keep
&#8217;em there. I figure, though,&#8221; he added hopefully,
&#8220;that we&#8217;ve got him cornered in or around this
valley. We traced &#8217;em here, and we got sight
of &#8217;em yesterday. We&#8217;ll have &#8217;em before night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Brown grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve given orders to shoot to kill and not to
miss,&#8221; thundered the sheriff. &#8220;But I guess the
rewards offered for him would kind of steady the
aim of the man that got a crack at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s face went white, and his eyes shot
fire as he listened to the sheriff&#8217;s cruel laugh in
which the others in the room above now joined.</p>
<p>Lamy signaled that he wished to whisper in his
ear, and Rathburn bent his head, although he kept
the gun handy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to risk shootin&#8217; anybody if we
should be found or cornered,&#8221; Lamy whispered. &#8220;I
thought you ought to know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re cornered you leave it to me,&#8221; Rathburn
came back. &#8220;I have reasons for everything I&#8217;m
doing. An&#8217; don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;d rather be grabbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
for this simple trick of yours in Dry Lake than
for one or two jobs over in Arizona. If things
go wrong keep your mouth shut&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t talk! If
you start talking any time I&#8217;ll try to kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy drew back from the ferocity in Rathburn&#8217;s
tone and manner. That menacing message was again
in Rathburn&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that boy out there?&#8221; the sheriff called
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go in and say how-do-you-do,&#8221; came the girl&#8217;s
voice from the kitchen. &#8220;It&#8217;s my brother, Frankie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, Frankie,&#8221; said the sheriff.</p>
<p>The pair below heard light footsteps on the floor
above.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine crop of freckles you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; said
the sheriff.</p>
<p>Rathburn saw Lamy put a hand to his face and
make a grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Frankie, did you see anybody around here
this morning?&#8221; asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&ndash;&ndash;who you looking for?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>
<p>Rathburn started; his body suddenly tensed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for an outlaw they call The Coyote,&#8221;
returned the sheriff. &#8220;Ever hear of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-e-s. Ed brought home a notice about a reward
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man we&#8217;re after. Rides a dun-colored horse;
tall, light-complexioned. Seen anybody
like that around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was here day before yesterday,&#8221; said the boy
truthfully. &#8220;Sis gave him something to eat, an&#8217;
he went on into town. He didn&#8217;t seem like such
a bad man to me. Told me never to lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was here? Ate here?&#8221; The sheriff&#8217;s voice
was excited.</p>
<p>Rathburn saw Lamy&#8217;s eyes widen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankie,&#8221; the sheriff said soberly, &#8220;that Coyote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
went into town an&#8217; robbed a place. He&#8217;s a bad,
dangerous man no matter how he looks or what
he says. Have you seen anybody that looked like
him since?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was followed by a deep silence.</p>
<p>Rathburn alert, his eyes gleaming, heard the sheriff
rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me, boy. I&#8217;m the sheriff of this county!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t that&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;tain&#8217;t that,&#8221; said the boy in a
tremulous voice. &#8220;Only&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d rather not tell, Mr.
Sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must answer me!&#8221; said the official sternly.
&#8220;Have you seen any one around here&ndash;&ndash;yesterday or
this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-e-s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; demanded the sheriff. &#8220;Don&#8217;t lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This&ndash;&ndash;this morning,&#8221; stammered the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? Tell me about it, quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two men ran across from the timber to the
house,&#8221; replied the boy. &#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;he said not to lie
for him&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff stepped quickly to the kitchen door.
&#8220;I thought you said no one had been around here,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t see any one,&#8221; came the girl&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw &#8217;em from the pasture,&#8221; the boy confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;re here!&#8221; cried the sheriff. &#8220;Search
the house an&#8217; the barn!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dim, narrow cellar Rathburn was holding
his gun aimed at Lamy&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember what I said about keepin&#8217; your
mouth shut?&#8221; he asked in a low voice, his steel-blue
gaze boring into the other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Lamy gasped. Then he slowly nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your bond!&#8221; said Rathburn, as tramping
feet sounded overhead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CAUGHT IN THE CELLAR</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn rose and crouched under the trapdoor,
gun in hand. Lamy watched him, breathless,
perplexed, uncertain. They heard men running;
then there were no sounds from above and a deathly
stillness settled down.</p>
<p>Slowly and with infinite care Rathburn raised the
trapdoor an inch or two and listened intently. Lamy
scrambled to his knees on the pile of gunny sacks;
but Rathburn swung quickly upon him. They stared
at each other in the semidarkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said two,&#8221; breathed Lamy, a curious look
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; mocked Rathburn. &#8220;It&#8217;s me
they want&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t worry. I may make a break for
it, an&#8217; if I do there&#8217;s likely to be powder burned.
You can stay here an&#8217; get out when they take after
me, if I go,&#8221; said Rathburn, and the sneer in his
voice caused Lamy to flush uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Rathburn petted the gun in his hand. &#8220;But before
I make a break I want to tell you something that
I should have told you before this, when I had more
time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He bit off his speech as there came a sudden
recurrence of the sounds in the house. The trapdoor
closed down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the cellar?&#8221; came the sheriff&#8217;s authoritative
voice.</p>
<p>Many feet tramped upon the floor above them.
Then they heard the rug stripped back. There was
an exclamation from the sheriff and the sound of
moving feet suddenly was stilled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is there any one in the cellar?&#8221; the sheriff called.</p>
<p>Silence&ndash;&ndash;with Lamy pressing Rathburn&#8217;s knee with
a hand, and Rathburn smiling that queer, grim
smile which conveyed so much, yet nothing which
was tangible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get around here, you fellows,&#8221; they heard the
sheriff order.</p>
<p>The sound of boots and spurs attested to the
quickness with which his order was obeyed.</p>
<p>Rathburn leaned down suddenly and with lightning
swiftness jerked Lamy&#8217;s gun from its holster near
his side. He tossed the weapon to a corner of the
dark cellar just as the sheriff&#8217;s voice was heard
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coyote, if you&#8217;re down there I&#8217;m not going to
take a chance fumbling with that door. If you
ain&#8217;t there, then there won&#8217;t be any harm in what
I&#8217;m going to do. If I don&#8217;t hear anything when
I finish talking I&#8217;m going to give the signal to
my men to start shooting through the floor&ndash;&ndash;and
I mean it. If anybody&#8217;s down there it&#8217;d be good
sense to flip up that door and crawl out hands first,
an&#8217; those hands empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff, you&#8217;re bluffing!&#8221; said Rathburn loudly.</p>
<p>Then the sheriff spoke again in an exultant tone.
&#8220;I figured it was the best hidin&#8217; place you could
find, Coyote. You&#8217;re right; I was sort of bluffing,
but I might have changed my mind an&#8217; gone on
through with it. We&#8217;ve got you dead to rights,
Coyote; you haven&#8217;t got a chance. There&#8217;s seven of
us now an&#8217; every man is ready to open up if you
come out of there a-shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn slipped his gun back into his holster.
He raised the trapdoor slowly until it tipped back
on the floor leaving the opening into the cellar clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of &#8217;em!&#8221; he heard some one exclaim.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>He looked up to accustom his eyes to the light
and saw a dozen guns covering him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, the landscape fairly bristles with artillery,&#8221;
he said amiably. &#8220;Who&#8217;s the sheriff? And&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
Jud Brown. Who let you loose, Jud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Sheriff Neal,&#8221; interposed that individual,
a slight, dark man with a bristly mustache. &#8220;Come
out of there&ndash;&ndash;hands free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the time being, eh, sheriff? I expect you figure
on fixing those hands so they won&#8217;t be free,
eh? Well, all I&#8217;ve got to say is that I hope you
won&#8217;t spend the money foolishly, sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn leaped lightly out of the cellar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep that other man down there covered, too,&#8221;
snapped out Neal. &#8220;It&#8217;s principle more than reward
money that invites me, Coyote. Hand over your
gun belt an&#8217; be careful how you unbuckle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff, it would be against my code of ethics
to hand over my gun. It can&#8217;t be done, sheriff;
you&#8217;ll have to come and get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neal hesitated, notwithstanding the fact that he
had Rathburn covered and that several other guns
were covering him. Then he stepped forward, never
taking his eyes from Rathburn&#8217;s, and secured the
other&#8217;s weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better, sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn with a
queer smile. &#8220;You can see how I have my pride
an&#8217; little superstitions. No man has ever took a
gun from me but what I&#8217;ve got it back! Thanks,
sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy had come out of the cellar. Several of
the men seemed to recognize him, but kept their
silence with dubious looks in their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;My guide, sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn, pointing gayly
at Lamy. &#8220;He was very kind. He showed me
around the country&ndash;&ndash;me not being very well acquainted
around here. I had to take his gun away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
from him an&#8217; sort of encourage him along with
my own, but he did very nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I thought, Neal,&#8221; said Brown. &#8220;This
fellow took after him an&#8217; he captured him and made
him lead him. Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221; he asked of Lamy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, Jud,&#8221; Rathburn interrupted with
a frown. &#8220;I can&#8217;t let the importance of this momentous
occasion be transferred to a subordinate.
You must ask your questions of me, as I am the
central figure in this affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry of a girl startled them. She came running
from the kitchen where she had fled when
the sheriff announced his intention to shoot through
the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ed!&#8221; she cried, running to Lamy and throwing
her arms about him. &#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;Ed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked the sheriff. &#8220;Your
husband?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my brother&ndash;&ndash;Ed Lamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can recommend him if you need a guide who
knows the country, sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn genially.
&#8220;I guess he had an idea of making trouble for me
at first, but I had the drop on him an&#8217; he soon
saw reason. I had to knock him down last night
when he got fresh, but he did very well. Of course
I had an advantage on my side.&#8221; He nodded toward
his gun which the official still held in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he make you guide him?&#8221; Neal asked Lamy,
noting his empty holster.</p>
<p>Rathburn turned so that he could look at his
former captive.</p>
<p>Lamy nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
what minute I was goin&#8217; to get shot in the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes glowed with an amused light. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t have any idea of shootin&#8217; him, sheriff; he
was too valuable as my escort on the tour. I wonder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
if the lady could spare me a cup of coffee an&#8217; a
biscuit?&#8221;</p>
<p>He glimpsed the boy in the kitchen doorway behind
the sheriff. &#8220;Hello, sonny,&#8221; he called cheerfully.
&#8220;Did you catch those freckles from your
brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy gazed at him abashed. There were actually
tears in the youngster&#8217;s eyes. Ed Lamy and
his sister moved into the kitchen and took the
boy with them. The girl had nodded to the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get you something to eat,&#8221; said Neal.
&#8220;What have you got on you?&#8221; He stepped to Rathburn&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;the frisk. I see you are a regulation officer,
sheriff.&#8221; Rathburn&#8217;s tone fairly radiated politeness
and good cheer. &#8220;The silver was rather heavy. It
ain&#8217;t my usual style to pack much silver, sheriff.
There&#8217;s more of the bills in my hip pockets. Don&#8217;t
suppose there&#8217;s more&#8217;n a thousand in the whole
bundle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff put the bills and silver on the table.
He investigated all of Rathburn&#8217;s pockets, returned
him his tobacco, papers, and handkerchief, but kept
a box of matches. Then he felt his prisoner&#8217;s clothing
to make sure that he had no weapons concealed;
he also felt his boot tops.</p>
<p>He looked at Rathburn with a gloating expression
when he had finished; there was also a glint
of admiration in the gaze he directed at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You size right up to the descriptions of you,
Coyote,&#8221; he reflected in a pleasant voice. &#8220;Too
bad you couldn&#8217;t have been in a better business.
I&#8217;m glad I caught you, but I ain&#8217;t any too&ndash;&ndash;too&ndash;&ndash;well,
I might say any too proud of it. That may
be pleasant for you to hear. But I ain&#8217;t discounting
your well-known ability, an&#8217; I want to warn you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
that I or any of my men will shoot you in your
tracks if you start anything that looks suspiciouslike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn yawned. &#8220;Sheriff, your courtesy is very
greatly appreciated. I only hope we will arrive in
jail or somewhere soon where I can get some sleep.
I&#8217;m all in.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>FREEDOM BEHIND BARS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the early afternoon the little cavalcade rode into
Dry Lake. Rathburn was nodding in his saddle,
nearly asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep him here to-night till I can get the
facts straight,&#8221; he heard Sheriff Neal say to Brown.</p>
<p>They dismounted at a small square stone building
with bars on the windows. Then Rathburn was
proudly led between a line of curious spectators
into jail.</p>
<p>Three rooms comprised Dry Lake&#8217;s jail. The
front of the building, for a depth of a third of the
distance from the front to the rear, was divided
into two of these rooms; one, the larger, being the
main office, and the other, much smaller, being the
constable&#8217;s private office. The balance of the building
was one large room, divided into two old-fashioned
cages with iron and steel bars. The
doors to these cages were on either side of the
door into the front office and there was an aisle
between the cages and the wall separating them
from the offices.</p>
<p>Rathburn was taken immediately to the cage on
the left of the office door. Sheriff Neal hesitated
as he stood in the cell with him, thought for a
minute, then removed the handcuffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right fine of you, sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn
sleepily, but cheerfully, nevertheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll be watched well enough,&#8221; said Neal
as he closed the barred door behind him and locked
Rathburn in. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find somebody around if
you try to tear the place down.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t just what I was getting at, sheriff,&#8221;
said the prisoner with a glitter in his eyes. &#8220;I
meant it was right fine of you to give me freedom
behind the bars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s taunting laugh rang in the official&#8217;s
ears as the latter pushed the men with him into
the outer office. Rathburn listened, yawning, to the
sheriff giving instructions that the prisoner be watched
constantly.</p>
<p>He looked about the cage which was separated
from the other cell by a wall of sheet iron. It
contained nothing except a bench and a stool. He
pushed the bench against the stone wall at the
rear and reclined upon it, using his coat for a
pillow. Then he turned his face toward the wall,
shading his eyes from the light, which filtered
through two windows high in the wall beyond the
bars on the left side by tipping his hat over his face.</p>
<p>Immediately he fell asleep.</p>
<p>The news that The Coyote had been captured,
spread rapidly through the town and many came
to the jail hoping they might be able to see the
prisoner. All of these were denied admittance, but
Sheriff Neal told the few who stated that they
had been among the number the bandit had lined
up at the point of his guns, that they would be
called to identify The Coyote on the following day.
He asked each if they were sure the bandit had
two guns, and the reply in each case was in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; Neal muttered. &#8220;He only had one
gun on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n likely the other&#8217;s on his horse with his
saddle,&#8221; Brown pointed out. &#8220;I believe he left
his horse somewheres an&#8217; made that fellow Lamy
take him to the house thinking he could get something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
to eat there, and that they wouldn&#8217;t be so
likely to be seen in the open on foot. You got to
remember that man&#8217;s more or less clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>This explanation satisfied Neal, and in the minds
of the men who had been in the resort when it was
held up, there was no question as to the identity
of the robber. Even if they had suspected otherwise
it is doubtful if they would have acknowledged
it because they considered it less of an ignominy
to be held up by the notorious Coyote than by a
bandit of lesser reputation.</p>
<p>Thus did the bonds of evidence tighten about
Rathburn while he slept through the late afternoon
and the twilight.</p>
<p>When he awoke a faint yellow light dimly illuminated
his surroundings. He lay thinking for
several minutes. He knew night had fallen and
surmised that he had slept a full eight hours. He
could tell this because he was fully awake and
alert. He turned noiselessly on his bench and saw
that the light came from a lamp burning near the
door to the outer office.</p>
<p>Rathburn could hear the hum of voices, and by
listening intently, ascertained that two men were
talking, one of whom was the sheriff. He could
not recognize the voice of the other speaker as a
voice he had ever heard before, and he could not
hear what they were saying.</p>
<p>He listened dully to the voices until he heard
a horse&#8217;s hoofs in front of the jail. He turned
back with his face to the wall, and his hat tipped
over his eyes, as a man entered the jail office with
a stamp of boots and jingle of spurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, constable,&#8221; he heard the sheriff say. &#8220;What
luck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t find the hoss,&#8221; came a disgruntled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
voice. &#8220;Looked all afternoon an&#8217; till it got dark
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound it!&#8221; exclaimed Neal. &#8220;The horse must
have been somewhere aroun&#8217; close. He sure didn&#8217;t
walk down the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s probably right,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;I left
a couple of your men out there to keep up searching
when daylight comes. That feller Lamy showed
us about where they left the hosses&ndash;&ndash;his hoss an&#8217;
The Coyote&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;but they wasn&#8217;t there. He said
there was a bunch of wild hosses in the valley
an&#8217; that they&#8217;d probably got away an&#8217; gone with
&#8217;em. We saw the wild hosses, but we couldn&#8217;t
get anywhere near &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;couldn&#8217;t get near enough
to see if any of &#8217;em was wearin&#8217; saddles or not.
We had some chase while it lasted, I&#8217;ll recite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Lamy say how they came to leave their
horses?&#8221; asked the sheriff in an annoyed tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was The Coyote&#8217;s orders. Thought they&#8217;d
be safer in the middle of the posse or something
like that. Made Lamy leave the hosses an&#8217; run
for the house an&#8217; made him get down in the cellar
with him. Don&#8217;t know if he knew Lamy lived
there or not, but reckon it wouldn&#8217;t have made
any difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff was pacing the floor of the office
as his footfalls attested. &#8220;I&#8217;ve ordered that Lamy
in to-morrow. I&#8217;ve a lot more questions to ask
him. Well, you might as well get a few winks,
constable; Brown and the rest of &#8217;em have hit
the hay. Even the prisoner is tired out, and that&#8217;s
sayin&#8217; something for as tough a bird as he is.
But I wish I had his horse. I&#8217;ve got to have his
horse!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn was smiling at the wall. He heard
Neal walk to the door and look in. Receding footsteps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
told him that the constable was leaving. For
a time there was silence in the outer office.</p>
<p>Rathburn sat up quietly and began easing off his
right boot. The boot came slowly, very slowly, as
Rathburn worked at it, careful not to make any
noise. Then, just as it came free, the sheriff again
strode to the door and looked in.</p>
<p>He saw Rathburn yawning, as the boot dropped
on the floor.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked at the sheriff sleepily as the
official strode into the aisle and peered in between
the bars. He tipped the bootless foot back on its
toes as he lifted his other foot and tugged at the
boot.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, sheriff?&#8221; he asked with another yawn.
&#8220;The lights are so bad I can&#8217;t see good. Guess
I&#8217;m a little groggy anyway. I was too danged tired
when I went to sleep to take off my boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got another ten hours to sleep,&#8221; said
Neal with a scowl. &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll have plenty of
time to get rid of your saddle soreness. You&#8217;ll
ride in automobiles and trains for a while an&#8217; keep
in out of the hot sun an&#8217; the wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff laughed harshly at his own words.</p>
<p>Rathburn let the other boot drop. &#8220;I expect
I&#8217;ll get something to eat now an&#8217; then, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feel hungry?&#8221; asked Neal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might chaw on a biscuit before I take another
nap,&#8221; yawned the prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see if I can scare you up a bite,&#8221; said the
sheriff, leaving.</p>
<p>Rathburn heard him say something to some one
in front. Then the sheriff went out of the building.
The other man came in and looked at Rathburn
curiously.</p>
<p>He was of medium build, with white hair and
a face seamed and lined and red. Rathburn instantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
recognized in his jailer a man of the desert&ndash;&ndash;possibly
of the border country.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re The Coyote,&#8221; said the jailer in a
rather high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>Rathburn winked at him. &#8220;That&#8217;s what they
say,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You size up to him, all right,&#8221; observed the
man of the desert. &#8220;An&#8217; I can tell quick enough
when I get a good look at you an&#8217; inspect your
left forearm. I&#8217;ve had your descriptions in front
of my eyes on paper an&#8217; from a dozen persons that
knowed you for three years!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You been trailing me?&#8221; asked Rathburn curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have; an&#8217; it ain&#8217;t no credit to this bunch here
that they got you, for I was headed in this direction
myself an&#8217; arrived &#8217;most as soon as you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You from Arizona?&#8221; asked Rathburn, grasping
his right foot in his left hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Arizony an&#8217; Mexico an&#8217; a few other
places,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve helped catch men
like you before, Coyote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn frowned, still keeping his hand over
his right foot. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that word, Coyote,&#8221;
he said softly, holding the other&#8217;s gaze between the
bars. &#8220;A coyote is a cowardly breed of animal,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; a tricky one,&#8221; said the jailer. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
sayin&#8217; you&#8217;re a coward; but you&#8217;re tricky, an&#8217; that&#8217;s
bad enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; agreed Rathburn. &#8220;Ah&ndash;&ndash;here&#8217;s our
friend, his nibs, the sheriff. He went out to rustle
me some grub. He wants to keep me fat for
hanging!&#8221;</p>
<p>His laugh rang through the jail, empty save
for himself and the two officers. But the temporary
jailer hesitated, looking at Rathburn&#8217;s eyes, before
he turned to the sheriff.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Open the door and I&#8217;ll take it in to him,&#8221; ordered
the sheriff. &#8220;Can&#8217;t get this stuff through the bars.
You might keep him covered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jailer&#8217;s hand flew to his hip for his gun
as he also brought up a large key on a ring. He
unlocked the door to the cage and held it open
while he kept his gun trained upon Rathburn.</p>
<p>The sheriff entered and placed the food on the
stool and a large bowl of coffee on the floor beside
it. Then he backed out, watching Rathburn keenly
as the latter sat on his bench with his right foot
in his hand.</p>
<p>When the door clanged shut and the key rattled
in the lock, Rathburn let down his right foot, took
two steps, and pulled the stool to the bench. He
stepped back and secured the coffee. Then he began
to eat and drink, keeping his right foot tipped on
its toes, while the two officials watched him attentively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn suddenly, between bites
on a huge meat sandwich, &#8220;could you let me have
a stub of a lead pencil an&#8217; a sheet of paper to
write a letter on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy enough,&#8221; answered Neal. &#8220;Course, you
know all mail that goes out of the jail is read
by us before it&#8217;s delivered&ndash;&ndash;if it&#8217;s delivered at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll chance it,&#8221; snapped out Rathburn.</p>
<p>As the sheriff left to get the writing materials,
with the jailer following him, doubtless for a whispered
confab as to what Rathburn might be wanting
to write and its possible bearing on his capture,
the prisoner hastily ran his left hand down into
his right sock and with some difficulty withdrew
a peculiar-shaped leather case about ten inches long
and nearly the width of his foot. This he put within
his shirt.</p>
<p>When the officials returned he had finished his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
repast and was waiting for them near the bars
with a smile of gratitude on his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may be a confession I&#8217;m going to write,&#8221;
he said, grinning at Neal. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take me
a long time, I reckon, but you said I had something
like ten hours for sleep, so I guess I can spare
two or three for this effort at literary composition.
I figure, sheriff, that this&#8217;ll be my masterpiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>His look puzzled the sheriff as he took the pencil
and paper through the bars and returned to his
bunk. He drew up the stool and sat upon it. It
was a little lower than the bench, so, putting his
paper on the bench, he had a fairly good makeshift
desk. He began to write steadily, and after
a few minutes the sheriff and jailer retired to the
office.</p>
<p>It did not take Rathburn a quarter of an hour
to write what he wished on the first of the several
pieces of paper. He tore off what he had written,
doubled it again and again into a small square,
took out his sack of tobacco which he had been
allowed to retain, and put it therein with the loose
tobacco.</p>
<p>Then he wrote for a few minutes on the second
sheet of paper.</p>
<p>When the sheriff looked in later he evidently was
slowly and laboriously achieving a composition.</p>
<p>Rathburn heard the sheriff go out of the front
door a few minutes later. Instantly he was alert.
He drew on his boots. He surmised that the sheriff
had gone out for something to eat and, though he
wasn&#8217;t sure of this, it was true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, jailer!&#8221; he called amiably.</p>
<p>The wrinkled face of the desert trailer appeared
in the office doorway.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked about from his seat on the stool.
&#8220;This job ain&#8217;t none too easy, as it is,&#8221; he complained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
&#8220;As a writer I&#8217;m a first-rate cow hand.
Lemme take your knife to sharpen this pencil with.
When I asked the sheriff for a stub of a pencil
he took me at my word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I&#8217;ll let you have my knife,&#8221; said the jailer
sarcastically. &#8220;How about my gun&ndash;&ndash;want that, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come on, old-timer,&#8221; pleaded Rathburn.
&#8220;The lead in this pencil&#8217;s worn clean down into the
wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand it over here an&#8217; I&#8217;ll sharpen it,&#8221; said the
jailer, drawing his pocketknife.</p>
<p>Rathburn walked to the bars and held out the
pencil. An amiable smile played on his lips. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to excuse me,&#8221; he said contritely. &#8220;I forgot
it wasn&#8217;t jail etiquette to ask for a knife. But I
ain&#8217;t had much experience in jail. Now according
to his nibs, the sheriff, I&#8217;m in to get pretty well
acquainted with &#8217;em, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched the jailer as he began sharpening the
pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of knives, now,&#8221; he continued in a
confiding tone, &#8220;I got in a ruckus down near the
border once an&#8217; some gents started after me. One
of &#8217;em got pretty close&ndash;&ndash;close enough to take some
skin off my shoulder with a bullet. He just sort
of compelled me to shoot back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you killed him,&#8221; observed the jailer,
pausing in his work of sharpening the pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t saying,&#8221; replied Rathburn. &#8220;Anyways
I had a hole-up down there for a few days, an&#8217;
as luck would have it, I had to put up with a
Mexican. All that Mex would do was argue that
a knife was better than a gun. He claimed it
was sure and made no noise&ndash;&ndash;those were his hardest
talking points, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be danged if there isn&#8217;t something
in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what I was gettin&#8217; at is that I didn&#8217;t have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
nothing to do, an&#8217; that Mexican got me to practicing
knife throwing. You know how slick those fellows
are at throwing a blade. Well, in the couple of
weeks that I hung aroun&#8217; there he coached me
along till I could throw a knife as good as he
could. He thought it was great sport, teaching
me to throw a knife so good, that a way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I left down there I&#8217;ve sort of practiced
that knife-throwing business now and then, just
for fun. Anyways I thought it was just for fun.
But now I see, jailer, that it was my luck protecting
me. Anything you learn is liable to prove handy
some time. <i>Don&#8217;t move an inch or I&#8217;ll let you
have it!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s hand snapped out of his shirt and up
above his right shoulder.</p>
<p>The man from the desert shuddered involuntarily
as he saw the yellow light from the lamp play
fitfully upon a keen, white blade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>AGAINST HIS ETHICS</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes held the other&#8217;s as completely
as would have been the case if he were invested
with a power to charm in some occult way. Moreover,
every trace of his amiable, confiding smile
was gone. His gaze was hard and cold and gleaming.
His face was drawn into grim lines. When
he spoke he talked smoothly, rapidly, and with an
edge to his words which convinced his listener that
he was in deadly earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not used to jails, my friend, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
aim to stay here. You&#8217;re not very far away an&#8217;
these bars are wide enough for me to miss &#8217;em;
but I don&#8217;t think I could miss you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jailer looked in horror at the gleaming knife
which Rathburn held by its hilt with the blade
pointing backward. The jailer was from the border;
he knew the awful possibilities of a quick motion of
the wrist in that position, a half turn of the knife
as it streaked toward its target. He shuddered again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now just edge this way about two steps so
your holster will be against the bars,&#8221; Rathburn
instructed. &#8220;I can drop you where you stand,
reach through the bars an&#8217; drag you close if need
be; but I&#8217;m banking on you having some good
sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jailer, without moving the hands which held
the pencil and his pocketknife, sidled up against the
bars.</p>
<p>Rathburn leaned forward. Keeping his right hand
high and tipped back, ready for the throw, he reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
out with his left, just through the bars, and secured
the jailer&#8217;s gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s all off,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;If the sheriff
or anybody else comes before I get out of here
I&#8217;m just naturally going to have to live up to the
reputation for shooting that they&#8217;ve fastened on me.
Unlock the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jailer wet his lips with his tongue. The
pencil and pocketknife fell to the floor. Covered
by his own gun, now in Rathburn&#8217;s hand, he moved
to the door, brought out his key, and opened it.
Still keeping him covered, Rathburn backed to the
bench, snatched up his coat, and walked out of the
cage, motioning to the jailer to precede him into
the office.</p>
<p>There he slipped the gun in his holster and put
on his coat. The jailer reckoned better than to try
to leap upon him while he was thus engaged; the
prisoner&#8217;s speed with a six-gun was well known.</p>
<p>Rathburn drew a peculiar leather case from within
his shirt, put the knife in it, and stowed it away
in a pocket. Then he turned on the jailer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you think that was a mean trick&ndash;&ndash;resorting
to a knife,&#8221; he said pleasantly; &#8220;but all is fair in
love and war and when a man&#8217;s in jail. You better
sort of stand in one place while I look around a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He backed behind the desk in the big office,
opened two or three drawers, and brought out a pair
of handcuffs. He moved around in front of the
jailer again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold out your hands,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;That&#8217;s
it.&#8221; He snapped the handcuffs on with one hand
while he kept the other on the butt of his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to have much to say,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; said the jailer. &#8220;I know when
a man&#8217;s got me dead to rights. But I&#8217;ll be on your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
trail again, an&#8217; if I ever get within shootin&#8217; distance
of you an&#8217; see you first, you&#8217;ll never get another
chance to pull a knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well said,&#8221; Rathburn admitted. &#8220;Now we understand
each other. But I don&#8217;t intend for you to
ever get within shooting distance of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn glanced casually about. &#8220;Now it seems
to me,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;that most of these fellows who
gum up their jail breaks make a mistake by hurrying.
Suppose you just walk natural-like through that
door and into the cage I just had the foresight to
leave. That&#8217;s it&ndash;&ndash;right on in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned the key which the jailer had left in the
lock. &#8220;Now you&#8217;re all right unless you start hollering,&#8221;
said Rathburn.</p>
<p>He stood quietly in the doorway between the office
and the cages. The man from the desert studied
him. He saw a variety of expressions flit over
Rathburn&#8217;s face&ndash;&ndash;anger, determination, scorn, resolve.
He was deliberately ignoring his opportunity
to make his escape while conditions were propitious;
he was waiting!</p>
<p>Although the jailer felt the urge to cry out in an
endeavor to make himself heard outside the jail and
thus bring help, something in the bearing of the man
standing in the doorway made him keenly curious to
watch the drama which he knew must be enacted
sooner or later before his eyes, for The Coyote was
certainly waiting for the sheriff.</p>
<p>Rathburn now drew the jailer&#8217;s gun from his own
holster and toyed with it to get its &#8220;feel&#8221; and balance.
He dropped it back into the holster and in a
wink of an eyelid it was back in his hand. The man
from the desert gasped at the lightning rapidity of
the draw. Time and again the gun virtually leaped
from the holster into The Coyote&#8217;s hand at his hip,
ready to spit forth leaden death. The jailer drew a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
long breath. The man was accustoming himself to
the weapon which had come into his possession, making
sure of it. Now he again stood motionless in
the doorway, waiting&ndash;&ndash;waiting&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Boots stamped upon the steps outside, and Rathburn
drew back from the doorway in the aisle before
the cages.</p>
<p>The front door opened and a man entered.</p>
<p>Both the man in the cage and the man in the aisle
recognized the sheriff&#8217;s step as Neal closed the door,
paused for a look about the office, and then walked
toward the door leading into the jail proper.</p>
<p>The jailer opened his mouth to sound a warning,
but something in Rathburn&#8217;s gaze and posture held
him silent. Rathburn&#8217;s body was tense; his gaze
was glued to the doorway; his right hand with its
slim, brown, tapered fingers, hung above the gun at
his side.</p>
<p>The sheriff loomed in the doorway. Without a
flicker of surprise in his eyes he took in the situation.
His lids half closed as his lips tightened to a thin,
white line. He met Rathburn&#8217;s gaze and knew that
he now faced The Coyote in the role which had won
him his sinister reputation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I mention to you that I wasn&#8217;t used to jails,
sheriff?&#8221; said Rathburn evenly, his words carrying
crisp and clear. &#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy &#8217;em. But I needed
the sleep and the meal. Now I&#8217;m going. Do you
recollect I said no one ever took my gun from me
but what I got it back? I had to borrow this one
from the gent in the cage. I&#8217;ll take my gun, sheriff&ndash;&ndash;<i>now!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Neal had watched him closely. He saw that while
he was speaking The Coyote did not for an instant
relax his vigilance. The merest resemblance of a
move would precipitate gun play.</p>
<p>He turned abruptly, and with Rathburn following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
him closely, went into the private room off the jail
office. He pointed to the other&#8217;s gun which lay upon
the flat desk where many had curiously inspected it.</p>
<p>Rathburn took it in his left hand and ascertained
at a glance that it wasn&#8217;t loaded. Therefore he
elected to carry it in his left hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t take a chance on feeding it right now,
sheriff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Under the circumstances it would
be right awkward. If you make up your mind to
draw I&#8217;ll have to depend on a strange gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheriff Neal&#8217;s eyes glittered; his lips parted just
a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if you&#8217;ll walk back toward the cage, sheriff,&#8221;
Rathburn prompted. &#8220;Correct&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t stumble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neal backed slowly out of the door, through the
second door into the aisle before the cages, watching
Rathburn like a cat.</p>
<p>Rathburn slipped his own weapon into his left hip
pocket and with his left hand dug into his trousers
pocket for the key to the cage. He didn&#8217;t take his
eyes from Neal&#8217;s as he brought it out and inserted it
in the lock. His right hand continued to hang above
the gun he had taken from the jailer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff,&#8221; he said with a cold ring in his voice,
&#8220;this may seem like an insult, but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ask
you to unlock that cage and go in. You can take
your time if you want, but I warn you fair that if
any one should start coming up the steps outside I&#8217;ll
try to smoke you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer Neal, with the glitter still in his eyes,
stepped to the cage door, unlocked it, and swung it
open.</p>
<p>He took a step, whirled like a flash&ndash;&ndash;and the
deafening report of guns crashed and reverberated
within the jail&#8217;s walls.</p>
<p>Neal staggered back within the cage, his gun clattering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
to the floor, his right hand dropping to his
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t been up against a strange gun I
wouldn&#8217;t have hit your finger, sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn
mockingly. &#8220;I was shootin&#8217; at your gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shut the cage door quickly, locked it, and stuck
the key in his pocket. Then he threw the jailer&#8217;s
gun in through the bars and thrust his own weapon
in its holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you gentlemen inside, an&#8217; armed,&#8221; he said
laughingly. &#8220;If the jailer will be so good as to read
what&#8217;s written on the paper on the bench, he&#8217;ll learn
something to his advantage. Sheriff, you an&#8217; Brown
were wrong in this, but the devil of it is you&#8217;ll never
know why.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left Neal pondering this cryptic sally, ran to the
front door, opened it, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Neal clutched his injured fingers and swore freely,
although there was amazement in his eyes. He could
have been killed like a rat in a trap if The Coyote had
felt the whim.</p>
<p>The man from the desert stepped to the bench and
read on the sheet of paper:</p>
<p>If anybody ever gets to read this they will
know that what I said about learning to throw
a knife is true. I can do it. I&#8217;ve carried that
knife in a special case that would fit in my sock
and boot for just such an emergency as came up
to-night. But I never would have throwed it.
It would be against my ethics.</p>
<p>The man from the desert swore softly. Then he
hurriedly picked up his gun and fired five shots to
attract attention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A MAN AND HIS HORSE</h3>
</div>
<p>When Rathburn closed the outer door after him
he plunged down the steps and into the shadows
by the wall of the jail. Few lights showed in
the town, for it was past midnight. He could see
yellow beams streaming from the windows of the
resort up the street, however, as he hesitated.</p>
<p>He was mightily handicapped because he had no
horse. A horse&ndash;&ndash;his own horse, he felt&ndash;&ndash;was necessary
for his escape, but his horse was a long distance
away.</p>
<p>Rathburn stole across the street to the side on
which the big resort was situated, and slipped behind
a building just as the muffled reports came from
within the jail. After a short interval, five more
shots were heard, and Rathburn grinned as he realized
that the jailer had fired the remaining bullets
in his own and the sheriff&#8217;s guns.</p>
<p>He heard men running down the street. So he
hurried up street behind the buildings until he
reached the rear of the large resort, which was the
place Lamy had held up.</p>
<p>Peering through one of the rear windows he saw
the room was deserted except for the man behind
the bar. Even at that distance he could hear horses
and men down the street. Doubtless they were
crowding into the jail where the sheriff would insist
upon being liberated at once so he could lead the
chase and, as Rathburn had the key, this would result
in a delay until another key could be found, or
Brown, who probably had one, could be routed out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>Rathburn thought of this as he looked through the
window at the lonely bartender who evidently could
not decide whether to close up and see what it all
was about or not. But the thing which impressed
Rathburn most was the presence of a pile of sandwiches
and several cans of corned beef and sardines&ndash;&ndash;emergency
quick lunches for patrons&ndash;&ndash;on the back
bar. Also, he saw several gunny sacks on a box in
the rear of the place almost under the window
through which he was looking.</p>
<p>Rathburn stepped to the door in sudden decision,
threw it open, and walked in. His gun flashed into
his hand. &#8220;Quiet!&#8221; was all he said to the stupefied
bartender.</p>
<p>He scooped up one of the sacks, darted behind the
bar, brushed the sandwiches and most of the cans of
corned beef and sardines into it, and then slung it
over his left shoulder with his left hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheriff will return the money that was taken
from here,&#8221; he said coolly as he walked briskly to
the front door. &#8220;Play the game safe; stay where
you are!&#8221; he cautioned as he vanished through the
door.</p>
<p>There were no horses at the hitching rail, but he
saw several down the street in front of the jail. Men
were running back and forth across the street&ndash;&ndash;after
Brown, he surmised.</p>
<p>Again he stole around to the rear of the resort;
then he struck straight up into the timbered slope
above the town, climbing rapidly afoot with the distant
peaks and ridges as his guide.</p>
<p>Some two hours after dawn he sat on the crest of
a high ridge watching a rider come up the winding
trail from eastward. He had seen other riders
going in both directions from his concealment behind
a screen of cedar bushes. He had watched them
with no interest other than that exhibited by a whimsical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
smile. But he did not smile as he watched this
rider. His eyes became keenly alert; his face was
grim. His mind was made up.</p>
<p>When the rider was nearing his ambush, Rathburn
quickly scanned the empty stretch of trail to westward,
then leaped down and confronted the horseman.</p>
<p>Ed Lamy drew rein with an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much time, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t hanker to be
seen&ndash;&ndash;afoot,&#8221; said Rathburn quickly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s my
horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in a pocket on a shale slope this side of the
timber on a line from the house where you left him,&#8221;
replied Lamy readily. &#8220;Or you can have mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want him,&#8221; said Rathburn curtly. &#8220;You
going in to see the sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lamy nodded. &#8220;His orders. Say, Coyote&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll probably meet you on the way,&#8221; Rathburn
interrupted with a sneer. &#8220;You can be figurin&#8217; out
what to say to him. My saddle with the horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hanging from a tree where you go into the
pocket. Big limestone cliffs there below the shale.
Say, Coyote, my sister an&#8217; kid brother was tellin&#8217; me
about your visit that morning, an&#8217; I guess I understand&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stand here talkin&#8217;,&#8221; Rathburn broke in,
pulling the tobacco sack from his shirt pocket. He
extracted a folded piece of paper. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a note
I wrote you in jail before I left. Read it on the way
in when there&#8217;s no one watching you. Maybe you&#8217;ll
learn something from it; maybe you won&#8217;t. I expect
you wanted money to fix that ranch up; but you&#8217;ll
get further by doing a little irrigating from up that
stream than by trying to be a bandit. You just
naturally ain&#8217;t cut out for the part!&#8221;</p>
<p>With these words he handed Lamy the note and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
bounded back up the slope. The screen of cedar
bushes closed behind him as Lamy pushed on, looking
back, wondering and confused, with heightened
color in his face.</p>
<p>It was late that night when Lamy returned to the
little ranch house. Frankie had gone to bed, but his
sister was waiting up for him with a meal and hot
tea ready.</p>
<p>He talked to his sister in a low voice while he
ate. When he had finished he read the note for the
third time; read it aloud, so his sister could hear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Lamy</span>: I meant to take you back and give
you up, for I was pretty sore. Then I saw your
resemblance to your small brother by the freckles
and eyes and I remembered he had said something
about you saying some decent things about
me. I guess you thought they were nice things,
anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I thought maybe you got your ideas
about easy money from the stuff you&#8217;d heard
about me, and I sort of felt kind of responsible.
I thought I&#8217;d teach you a lesson by flirting with
that posse and telling you that killing story to
show you what a man is up against in this game.
I guess I can&#8217;t get away from it because they
won&#8217;t let me. But you don&#8217;t have to start. I
was going to give you a good talking to before
I let you go, but I hadn&#8217;t counted on the little
kid in the house. I&#8217;m glad he told the truth.
He&#8217;ll remember that. I gave you back your gun
because you hit the nail on the head when you
said if I was square I&#8217;d give it to you and let
you make a run for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the money off you so if they got us I
could take the blame and let you off. I can take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
the blame without hurting my reputation, so
don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m not doing this so much for
your sake as for your kid brother and your
sister. I figure you&#8217;d sort of caught on when I
heard they hadn&#8217;t located my horse. That was
a good turn. Do me another by getting some
sense. There&#8217;s plenty of us fellows that&#8217;s quite
capable to furnish the bad examples.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Rathburn</span>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The girl was crying softly with an arm about her
brother&#8217;s neck when he finished reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what are you going to do, Eddie?&#8221; she
sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to irrigate!&#8221; said Ed Lamy with a new
note in his voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to build a sure-enough
ranch for us with this piece of paper for a corner
stone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dawn was breaking over the mountains, strewing
the gleaming peaks with warm rosettes of color. A
clear sky, as deep and blue as any sea, arched its
canopy above. Virgin stands of pine and fir marched
up the steep slopes to fling their banners of green
against the snow. Silver ribbons of streams laughed
in the welcome sunlight.</p>
<p>In a rock-walled gulch, far above the head of
Sunrise Ca&ntilde;on, a fire was burning, its thin smoke
streamer riding on a vagrant breeze. Near by lay a
dun-colored horse on its side, tied fast. A man was
squatting by the blaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to have to do this, old hoss,&#8221; the man
crooned; &#8220;but we&#8217;ve got to change the pattern of
that CC2 brand if we want to stick together, an&#8217; I
reckon we want to stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust the running iron deeper into the glowing
coals.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE WITNESS</h3>
</div>
<p>The morning was hardly two hours old, and the
crisp air was stinging sweet with the tang of
pine and fir, as Rathburn rode jauntily down the trail
on the eastern slope of the divide and drew rein on
the crest of a high ridge. As he looked below he
whistled softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juniper, hoss, there&#8217;s folks down there plying a
nefarious trade, a plumb dangerous trade,&#8221; he mused,
digging for the tobacco and brown papers in the
pocket of his shirt. &#8220;I reckon they&#8217;re carrying on in
direct defiance of the law, hoss.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dun-colored mustang tossed his head impatiently,
but his master ignored the animal&#8217;s fretful
desire to be off and dallied with tobacco and paper,
fashioning a cigarette, lighting it, breathing thin
smoke as his gray eyes squinted appraisingly at the
scene below.</p>
<p>Winding down into the foothills, in striking contrast
to the dim trails higher up, was a well-used
road. It evidently led from the saffron-tinted dump
and gray buildings of a mine which showed on the
side of a big, bald mountain to southward. At a
point almost directly below the ridge where the man
and horse stood, it crossed a small hogback and
descended a steep slope between lines of jack pines,
disappearing in the timber farther down.</p>
<p>The gaze of the man on the ridge was concentrated
on the bit of road which showed on the hogback and
the slope beyond. A truck was laboriously climbing
the ascent. But the watcher evidently was not so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
much concerned with the approach of the truck as
with certain movements which were in progress on
the hogback at the head of the grade.</p>
<p>Three persons had dismounted from their horses
behind the screen of timber. One, a tall man, had
donned a long, black slicker and was tying a handkerchief
about his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juniper, hoss,&#8221; said Rathburn, &#8220;what does that
gent want that slicker on for? It ain&#8217;t going to rain.
An&#8217; how does he reckon to see onless maybe he&#8217;s got
holes cut in that there hanky?&#8221;</p>
<p>A second man had made his way down the slope a
short distance. He took advantage of the timber
which screened him from sight of the driver of the
oncoming truck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;spect that&#8217;s in case the truck driver should
suddenly take it into his head to slide down backwards,&#8221;
said the observer, speaking his thoughts
aloud in a musical, bass voice. &#8220;One in front, one
behind; now how about the kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>As if in answer to his question the third member
of the party, evidently a boy, led the horses a short
way up the hogback where a good view could be
obtained of the road in both directions.</p>
<p>The watcher grunted in approval. &#8220;One in front
to do the stick-up, one behind to stop a retreat and
get whatever it is they&#8217;re after, and one on the lookout
to see there ain&#8217;t any unexpected guests. Couldn&#8217;t
have planned the lay any better ourselves, hoss.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was too far distant to interfere, even if he had
had any desire to do so, which was doubtful from his
interested and tolerant manner. Anyway it could
have done no good to shout a warning, for the
driver of the truck could not have heard anything
above the roar of his machine, and the trio had gone
about the preparations with dispatch. Already the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
truck was climbing the last steep pitch to the top of
the hogback.</p>
<p>The tall man in the black slicker and mask now
quickly stepped forth from the edge of the timber.
The watcher above saw his right hand and arm whip
out level with his shoulders. There was a glint of
morning sunlight and dull metal. The truck came to
a jarring stop as the driver jammed on the brakes.
Then the driver&#8217;s hands went into the air.</p>
<p>Stepping from the timber at the roadside behind
the truck, the second man leaped upon the machine.
The watcher grunted again as he saw that this man
was also masked. The driver was disarmed and
searched, then forced to clamber down from the truck
into the road, where the man in the slicker kept him
covered while the other quickly searched about the
seat and cab of the truck. Then the second man
released the brakes and dropped nimbly from the
machine which plunged backward down the steep
slope, crashed into the tree growth on one side of
the road, and overturned.</p>
<p>The boy mounted and led the other two horses
down the hogback in the scanty timber to the head
of the grade. There the man in the slicker and his
companion joined him, mounted, and the trio rode
quickly along the hogback in a southerly direction
and disappeared on a blind rail into the forest.</p>
<p>Rathburn rolled himself another cigarette with a
grin as he watched the truck driver stand for some
moments uncertainly in the road and then start rapidly
down the slope toward his disabled machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, hoss,&#8221; said the erstwhile spectator, turning
his dun-colored mount again into the trail. &#8220;So
far&#8217;s I can make out, this is the only way down out
of these tall mountains to the east, so we might as
well get going. We ain&#8217;t got no business south or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
west. We&#8217;ll be just in time to get blamed for what&#8217;s
happened down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever there might be in the prospect, the rider
did not permit it to have any influence on his cheerful
mood. He drew in long breaths of the stimulating
air and sniffed joyously at the fragrance of the
murmuring forests which clothed the higher hills.
Far below the timber would dwindle, the ridges
would flatten into round knolls and lose their verdure;
then would come the dust and lava slopes, and
beyond&ndash;&ndash;the desert.</p>
<p>A wistful light came into the horseman&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;Home, Juniper, hoss,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just
got to have cactus an&#8217; water holes an&#8217; danged blistering
heat in ours; and I don&#8217;t care so much as the
faded label off an empty tomato can if it&#8217;s in California,
or Arizona, or Nevada, so long as it&#8217;s desert!&#8221;</p>
<p>The trail he was following wound tortuously
around ridges, through the timber, into ravines and
ca&ntilde;ons; now treading close upon the bank of a swift-running
mountain stream in a narrow valley, and
again seeking the higher places where there were rocks
and fallen trees and other obstructions. An observer
would have gleaned at once that the rider was not
familiar with the trail or territory he traversed.</p>
<p>So it was past noon when he finally reached the
hogback where the outstanding event of the morning
had taken place. The rider looked back up toward
the divide and grinned as he rested his horse just
above the scene of the holdup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reckon they&#8217;d have heard me if I&#8217;d hollered,
or seen me if I&#8217;d waved,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;They picked
out a good spot for the dirty work,&#8221; he concluded,
looking about.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, as he was staring down at the
tracks in the road, he smothered an exclamation.
Then he dismounted, picked up two small objects
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
from the dust at the point where the trio had started
on their get-away, examined them with a puzzled expression,
and thrust them into a pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer,&#8221; he ruminated; &#8220;mighty queer. If those
silly things had been laying there in the road before
the rumpus they&#8217;d have been tracked into the dust.
But they was on <i>top</i> of a perfectly good hoss track.
An&#8217; it don&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s been anybody along here
since.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued down the road, descending the steep
slope, and came to the overturned truck. At a glance
he saw it had been used for hauling supplies, doubtless
to the mine he had glimpsed on the slope of the
high mountain to southward. Several kegs of nails,
some hardware, and some sacks of cement were scattered
in the road. He remembered that the man
who had climbed on the truck had only searched the
driver and the cab. Anything he might have taken
must have been in a small package or it would have
been discernible even at that long distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;That outfit wasn&#8217;t after no mine supplies,&#8221; Rathburn
reflected as he finished his brief inspection and
again mounted. &#8220;An&#8217; they wasn&#8217;t taking any chances
on smoking anybody up or being followed too quick.
Pretty work all around. An&#8217; here&#8217;s the committee,
hoss!&#8221;</p>
<p>A touring car came careening around a turn in the
road and raced toward him. He turned his horse to
the side of the road and spoke to him as the animal,
plainly unfamiliar with motor cars, snorted and shied.</p>
<p>The car drew to a stop with a screeching of brakes.
The horseman raised his hands as he saw two rifles
leveled at him from the rear seat. There were five
men in the car besides the driver. One of the men,
who had been sitting in the front with the driver,
leaped from the machine and strode toward the rider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Calm that horse down an&#8217; climb out of that saddle,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
he commanded. &#8220;If you make any motions
toward that gun you&#8217;re packing, it&#8217;ll make things
simpler, in a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rider slipped from the saddle with a broad
grin. &#8220;Right up to form,&#8221; he sang cheerfully, although
he kept his hands elevated while the other
took his gun. &#8220;My hoss&#8217;ll be calm enough now that
that danged thing is shut off. You must be a sheriff
to be flirting with the speed limit that way an&#8217; forgetting
you&#8217;ve got a horn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you from an&#8217; where was you going?&#8221;
demanded the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from up in the mountains, but I&#8217;d never got
where I was going if I hadn&#8217;t seen you first the way
you busted around that curve,&#8221; was the cool reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; was the next comment in a tone of
satisfaction. &#8220;Look here, friend, I&#8217;m Mannix, deputy
from High Point. You&#8217;ll sail smoother if you answer
my questions straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy motioned to two men in the car.
&#8220;Search him,&#8221; he ordered. Then he stood back, six-shooter
in hand.</p>
<p>The stranger built a cigarette while the men were
going through him. He lighted the weed and smiled
quizzically while they examined the meager contents
of the slicker pack on the rear of his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you&#8217;re packing a black slicker,&#8221; said Mannix,
pointing to the rough raincoat in which the pack was
wrapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s in case of rain,&#8221; was the ready answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; asked the deputy with a
frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rathburn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was you heading?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was aiming in a general eastern direction,&#8221;
Rathburn replied in a drawl. &#8220;Is there any law
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
against ridin&#8217; hosses in this here part of the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; replied the deputy heartily. &#8220;An&#8217;
there&#8217;s no law against drivin&#8217; automobiles or trucks.
But there&#8217;s a law against stoppin&#8217; &#8217;em with a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;You stopped because you
saw my gun? An&#8217; I&#8217;m to blame, for it? If I&#8217;d
known you were touchy about guns down here I&#8217;d
have worn mine in my shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the other men from the car had joined the
deputy. He was looking at Rathburn keenly. Mannix
turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look like him?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The man nodded. &#8220;About the same size and
height.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This man was drivin&#8217; a truck up here that was
stopped this morning,&#8221; said the deputy sternly to
Rathburn. &#8220;He says you size up to one of the men
that turned the trick&ndash;&ndash;one of them that wore a black
slicker like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded pleasantly. &#8220;Exactly,&#8221; he said
with a smile. &#8220;I happen to be in the country an&#8217;
I&#8217;ve got a black slicker. There you are; everything
all proved up. An&#8217; yet there was somebody once
told me it took brains to be a sheriff!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a glint in Rathburn&#8217;s eyes as he uttered
the last sentence.</p>
<p>Instead of flying into a rage, Mannix laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kid yourself,&#8221; he said grimly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not the man who held up this truck driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave Rathburn back his gun, to the latter&#8217;s
surprise. Then he waved toward Rathburn&#8217;s horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; he said, smiling. &#8220;General eastern
direction, wasn&#8217;t it? This road will take you clean
to the desert, if you want to go that far. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the others back to the car which started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
off with a roar. It passed the truck and continued on
up the road.</p>
<p>Rathburn sat his horse and watched the automobile
out of sight. His expression was one of deep
perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;By all the rules of the game that fellow should
have held me as a suspect,&#8221; he soliloquized. &#8220;Now
he don&#8217;t know me from a hoss thief&ndash;&ndash;or does he?&#8221;</p>
<p>He frowned and rode thoughtfully down the road
in the direction from which the automobile had come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE WELCOME</h3>
</div>
<p>The afternoon wore on as Rathburn followed the
road at an easy jog. He quickened his pace
somewhat when he passed through aisles in thick
timber, and, despite his careless attitude in the saddle,
he kept a sharp lookout at all times. For Rathburn
was carrying some gold and bills in a belt under
his shirt&ndash;&ndash;which had been examined and returned
to him at the order of the deputy&ndash;&ndash;and he had no
intention of being waylaid. Moreover, the man&#8217;s
natural bearing was one of constant alertness. He
rode for more than two hours without seeing any
one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; he observed aloud. &#8220;This road is used
a lot, too. Maybe the morning&#8217;s ceremonies has
scared all the travelers into the brush.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, as he turned the next bend in the road, he
saw a small cabin in a little clearing to the right.</p>
<p>Spurred by a desire to obtain some much-needed
information, he turned from the road into the clearing
and rode up to the cabin. He doffed his broad-brimmed
hat in haste as he saw a girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m a stranger in these woods an&#8217; I&#8217;m
looking for an honest man or woman to guide me
on my way,&#8221; he said with a flashing smile.</p>
<p>Instead of returning his smile with a gracious
word of greeting, the girl regarded him gravely out
of glowing, dark eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty!&#8221; he thought to himself. &#8220;Limping lizards,
but she&#8217;s pretty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; the girl asked soberly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&#8220;From yonder mountains, an&#8217; then some,&#8221; he
answered with a sweeping gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;You rode down this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rode down this morning. Down from the toppermost
top of the divide with the wind singing in
my whiskers an&#8217; the birds warbling in my ears.&#8221;
He laughed gayly, for he appreciated her puzzled
look. &#8220;I was wondering two things,&#8221; he continued
solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What might they be?&#8221; she asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;First: Why isn&#8217;t there more travel on this good
road?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen a soul except yourself
and a&ndash;&ndash;a party in an automobile. Now on a
road like this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you meet the automobile?&#8221; she asked
in a voice which he interpreted as eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hours an&#8217; some minutes back&ndash;&ndash;and up.
Near a truck which had had some trouble in the
road. Perhaps you heard about it? Turned over
on its side in collapse after some free-thinking gents
turned their smoke wagons toward it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was plain she was interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&ndash;&ndash;is the automobile still there?&#8221; she inquired
with a breathless catch in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. After some of the passengers had had
a little disrespectful conversation with me, it went on
up the road. Are they scarce around here, ma&#8217;am&ndash;&ndash;automobiles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; she replied with a frown. &#8220;They
truck ore and men and supplies to and from the mine
every day. The reason you&#8217;ve seen so few people
to-day is because it&#8217;s Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said gallantly. &#8220;That answers
my first question. You remember, I was wondering
<i>two</i> things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips trembled with a smile, but her eyes flashed
with suspicion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You will observe, ma&#8217;am, that I am not followed
by any pack horses or heavily-laden burros,&#8221; he went
on gravely, although his eyes sparkled with good
humor. &#8220;Nor is there anything much to speak of in
this slicker pack on my saddle. I need some new
smoking tobacco, some new shaving soap, some new
hair cut, a bath, a dinner, and a bed&ndash;&ndash;after I&#8217;ve put
up my hoss.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the girl laughed, and Rathburn was rewarded
by the flashing gleam of two rows of pearls
and eyes merry with mirth. But her reciprocating
mood of cheerfulness was quickly spent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are only a mile and a half from High
Point,&#8221; she said hurriedly. &#8220;You can get what you
want there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She retreated into the doorway, and Rathburn saw
that the chance interview was at an end.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Gracias</i>, as they say in the desert country,&#8221; he
said, saluting as he turned away. &#8220;It means thanks,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked back as he touched the mustang with
his steel and saw her looking after him with a
strange look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That gal looks half like she was scared, hoss,&#8221;
he reflected. &#8220;I wonder, now, if she got me wrong.
Dang it! Maybe she thought I was trying to flirt
with her. Well, maybe I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust a hand in a pocket and fingered the two
objects he had picked up in the road at the scene of
the holdup. Then he pulled his hat a bit forward
over his eyes and increased his pace. The town, as
he had half expected, came suddenly into sight
around a sharp bend in the road.</p>
<p>High Point consisted of some two-score structures,
and only a cursory glance was needed to ascertain
that it was the source of supplies and rendez-vous
for entertainment of the several mines and all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
the miners and prospectors in the neighboring hills.
Several fairly good roads and many trails led into it,
and from it there was a main road of travel to the
railroad on the edge of the desert in the east.</p>
<p>Before he entered the dusty, single street, lined
with small buildings flaunting false fronts, Rathburn
recognized the signs of a foothill town where the
hand of authority rested but lightly.</p>
<p>He rode directly to the first hotel, the only two-story
structure in town, and around to the rear where
he put up his horse and left his saddle, chaps and
slicker pack in the care of the barn man.</p>
<p>He received instructions as to the location of the
best barber shop and speedily wended his way there.
He found Sunday was not observed in the barber
shop, nor in the resort which adjoined it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any chance to get a bath here?&#8221; he asked one of
the two barbers with a twinkle in his gray eyes.</p>
<p>He expected a snort of astonishment and a sarcastic
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Want it first or after?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn eyed the barber suspiciously. Was the
man poking fun at him? Well, he was not a stranger
to repartee.</p>
<p>&#8220;First or after what?&#8221; he asked, scowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your shave and hair cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take it first&ndash;&ndash;if you have
it. An&#8217; if you have, I&#8217;ll say this is a first-class barber
shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The barber led the way to a room in the rear of
the place with a pleased grin.</p>
<p>An hour or so later Rathburn, with the lower part
of his face a shade paler than the upper half, his
dark hair showing neatly under his broad-brimmed
hat, his black riding boots glistening, and a satisfied
smile on his face, sauntered out of the barber shop
into the resort next door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>A man was lighting the hanging lamps, and Rathburn
looked about through a haze of tobacco smoke
at a cluster of crowded gaming tables, a short bar,
cigar counter, and at the motley throng which
jammed the small room.</p>
<p>He grinned as he read the sign over the cash
register:</p>
<p>FREE DRINKS TO-MORROW</p>
<p>&#8220;Swiped in broad daylight from the grand old
State of Texas,&#8221; he murmured aloud to himself.</p>
<p>Then he noticed a small restaurant in the rear of
the place, separated from the main room by a partition,
the upper part of which was glass.</p>
<p>He made his way back, passed through the door,
and took a seat at the counter which afforded him a
view of the resort through the glass. He ordered a
substantial meal and, while waiting for it to be
served, studied with calculating eyes the scene in the
next room.</p>
<p>The men were mostly of the hills&ndash;&ndash;miners constituting
the majority. Of professional gamblers
there were many, and there was also a plentiful
sprinkling of that despicable species known as
&#8220;boosters&#8221; whose business it is to sit in at the games
in the interest of &#8220;the house;&#8221; to fleece the victims
who occupy the few remaining seats.</p>
<p>But now he saw a man who apparently was not a
miner, or a prospector, nor yet a member of the professional
gambling tribe. This was a tall man, very
dark, sinewy. He wore a gun.</p>
<p>At first Rathburn thought he might be a cow-puncher,
for he wore riding boots, and had something
of the air and bearing of a cowman; but he
finally decided that this classification was inaccurate.
An officer at one of the mines, perhaps; a forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
ranger&ndash;&ndash;no, he didn&#8217;t wear the regalia of a ranger&ndash;&ndash;Rathburn
gave it up as his dinner was put before
him on the counter.</p>
<p>He fell to his meal eagerly, for he had had nothing
to eat since early morning when he had broken
camp high in the mountains to westward. Steak and
French &#8220;fries&#8221; began quickly to disappear, along with
many slices of bread and two cups of steaming coffee.
Then Rathburn looked up, and to his surprise
saw that the tall, dark man was standing near the
glass, studying him intently out of scowling, black
eyes.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked at him coolly and steadily for a
few moments and resumed his meal. But the other
was inquisitive and Rathburn sensed, without again
looking up, that he was being watched. Was this
man, then, an aide of Mannix, the deputy? He
doubted it.</p>
<p>He finished his meal, paid his score with an added
cheery word for the counter jumper, rose, entered
the main room of the resort, and walked directly up
to the dark man who still was observing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was you thinking I was an old acquaintance of
yours?&#8221; he asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s eyes narrowed, and Rathburn thought
he detected a glow of recognition and satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have your bath?&#8221; sneeringly inquired the
man.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s brows lifted. Then he smiled queerly.
&#8220;I sure did. Why? Did I maybe keep you waiting?
Was you next?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s eyes blazed with wrath. &#8220;Let me give
you a tip, my friend; you ain&#8217;t right well acquainted
in this here locality, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn now noted that they had attracted immediate
attention. The tall, dark man, then, was a
personage of importance. He noted another thing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
too&ndash;&ndash;rather, he realized it by instinct as well as by
certain mannerisms. The man before him knew how
to use the weapon which hung low on his right thigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean was I born here, or do I live here,
I&#8217;d say no,&#8221; Rathburn drawled; &#8220;but I happen to be
here at this precise time so I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m right well
acquainted with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A hush had come over the place. Interested faces
were turned in their direction, and Rathburn sensed
an ominous tremor of keen expectancy. The fine
wrinkles at the corners of his eyes tightened a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a poor time for strangers to be hanging
around,&#8221; said the dark man in a loud voice. &#8220;The
Dixie Queen pay-roll has been taking wings too
often.&#8221;</p>
<p>The implication and the murmur from the spectators
was not lost upon Rathburn. His lips tightened
into a fine, white line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever you are, you&#8217;ve got more mouth than
brains!&#8221; he said crisply in a voice which carried over
the room.</p>
<p>The effect of his words was electric. There was
a sharp intaking of breath from the spectators. The
dark man&#8217;s face froze, and his eyes darted red. His
right hand seemed to hang on the instant for the
swoop to his gun. Rathburn appeared to be smiling
queerly out of his eyes. Then came a sharp interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, Carlisle!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn recognized the voice of Mannix, and a
moment later the deputy stepped between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221; he asked coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman you just called Carlisle seems to
have appointed himself a reception committee to welcome
me into the enterprising town of High Point,&#8221;
drawled Rathburn, with a laugh.</p>
<p>Mannix turned on Carlisle with a scowl, and Carlisle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
shrugged impatiently, his eyes still glaring balefully
at Rathburn.</p>
<p>The deputy again confronted Rathburn. &#8220;Had
your supper?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best steak I&#8217;ve had in two months,&#8221; Rathburn
replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horse taken care of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First thing.&#8221; There was a note of derision in
Rathburn&#8217;s tone. &#8220;Service at the hotel barn is high
grade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix&#8217;s eyes hardened before he spoke again.
He hesitated, but when his words came they were
clear-cut and stern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come with me an&#8217; I&#8217;ll show you where to
sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean in jail?&#8221; queried Rathburn.</p>
<p>Mannix nodded coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn, in a peculiar tone, addressing
the deputy but looking over his shoulder directly
into Carlisle&#8217;s eyes; &#8220;if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m
noted for, it&#8217;s for being a good guesser!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE DIXIE&#8217;S BOSS</h3>
</div>
<p>If Mannix expected any resistance from Rathburn
he soon found that none was to materialize. The
deputy, a short, rather stout man of perhaps thirty-nine,
with bronzed features, clear, brown eyes, and a
protruding jaw covered with a stubble of reddish-brown
beard, was nevertheless wary of his prisoner.
He had not yet obtained Rathburn&#8217;s gun, and he
recognized the unmistakable signs of a seasoned gunman
in the lounging but graceful postures of his
prisoner, in the way he moved his right hand, in the
alertness of his eye. He frowned, for Rathburn was
smiling. There was a quality to that smile which
was not lost upon the doughty officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take it you&#8217;ve got sense enough to come along
easylike,&#8221; he said, with just a hint of doubt in his
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been known to show some sense, sheriff;
now that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask you for your gun,&#8221; said the deputy
grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been known to hand over my gun,
sheriff,&#8221; drawled Rathburn. &#8220;Now that&#8217;s another
fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the tension in the room was high. Others
than Mannix, and probably Carlisle, had readily
discerned in the gray-eyed stranger a certain menacing
prowess which is much respected where weapons
are the rule in unexpected emergencies. The crowd
backed to the wall.</p>
<p>The deputy wet his lips, and his face grew a shade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
paler. Then suddenly he went for his gun, as Rathburn
dropped, like a shot, to the floor. There came
the crack of Carlisle&#8217;s pistol and a laugh from Rathburn.
The deputy, gun in hand, stared at Rathburn
who rose quickly to his feet. Then he thought to
cover him. Rathburn raised his hands while Carlisle
returned his own smoking weapon to its holster.
Mannix turned and glared at Carlisle in perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what his game is, Mannix; but he
could have drawn down on you in a wink and shot
you in your tracks if he&#8217;d wanted to,&#8221; said Carlisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you were taking the play in your own hands,&#8221;
Mannix accused.</p>
<p>The deputy looked at Rathburn angrily. Then he
advanced and took the prisoner&#8217;s six-shooter from
him. He brought handcuffs out of his pockets.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s face went white. &#8220;If what Carlisle
says is true, it doesn&#8217;t look as if I was trying to get
away, does it, sheriff?&#8221; he asked coldly.</p>
<p>Mannix was thoughtful for a moment. &#8220;Well,
come along,&#8221; he ordered, thrusting the steel bracelets
back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; Carlisle volunteered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; snapped out the deputy. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t asking you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trio left the place as the spectators gazed after
them in wonder. There was a hum of excited conversation
as the deputy and his prisoner and Carlisle
passed through the door.</p>
<p>No word was spoken on the way to the small, two-room,
one-story structure which served as a detention
place for persons under arrest until they could be
transferred to the county jail in the town where the
railroad touched. Petty offenders served their sentences
there, however.</p>
<p>In the little front office of the jail, Rathburn
looked with interest at some posters on the walls.

One in particular claimed his attention, and he read
it twice while the deputy was getting some keys and
calling to the jailer, who evidently was on the other
side of the barred door where the few cells and the
&#8220;tank&#8221; were.</p>
<p>This is what Rathburn read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='center'><span style='font-weight:bold'>REWARD</span></p>
<p>Two thousand dollars will be paid for the
capture of the bandits who are responsible for
the robberies of Dixie Mine messengers in the
last few months.</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Dixie Milling &amp; Mining Co</span>.,<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span><br />
George Sautee, Manager.<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rathburn now knew exactly what Carlisle had
meant when he had referred to the Dixie pay-roll
taking wings. He had, however, suspected it. The
holdup of the truck driver also was explained. Rathburn
smiled. It was a peculiar ruse for the mines
manager to resort to. Could not the pay-roll be sent
to the mines under armed guard? Rathburn&#8217;s eyes
were dreamy when he looked at the deputy.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, in you go,&#8221; said Mannix, as the jailer
unlocked the heavy, barred door from the inside.</p>
<p>He led Rathburn to one of the single cells, of
which there were six on one side of the jail room
proper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll be ready to talk in the morning,&#8221; he
said, as he locked his prisoner in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning might be too late,&#8221; Rathburn observed,
taking tobacco and papers from his shirt pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; Mannix asked
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might change my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About talking, eh? Well, we&#8217;ll find a way to
make you change it back again.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a grateful cuss,&#8221; said Rathburn, grinning.</p>
<p>Mannix scowled. It was plain he was not sure of
his man, although he was trying to convince himself
that he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you,&#8221; he said growlingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No? Didn&#8217;t you hear that fellow Carlisle say I
saved your life by not drawing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d have got you if you&#8217;d tried to draw. That&#8217;s
what he thought you was going to do. You saved
your skin by grabbing the floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn wet the paper of his cigarette and sealed
the end. &#8220;I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; he mused, as he snapped
a match into flame, with a thumb nail and lit the
weed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time,&#8221; said the deputy grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; said Rathburn, in a soft voice,
exhaling a thin streamer of smoke, &#8220;if he&#8217;d have got
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix grunted, looked at him curiously, and then
turned abruptly on his heel and left. Rathburn could
not see the door, but he heard the big key grate in
the lock, and then the jail room echoed to the clang
of hard metal and the door swung shut again.</p>
<p>Rathburn sat down on the bunk which was to serve
as his bed. He smoked his brown-paper cigarette
slowly and with great relish while he stared, not
through the bars to where the dim light of a
lamp showed, but straight at the opposite steel wall
of his cell. His eyes were thoughtful, dreamy,
his brow was puckered.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; there&#8217;s that,&#8221; he muttered as he threw away
the stub of his smoke and began to roll another.
&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s been playing the Dixie Queen for a
meal ticket. That sign said &#8216;robberies.&#8217; That means
more&#8217;n one. The truck driver was the last. Two
thousand reward. An&#8217; me headed for the desert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
where I belong. What stopped me? I reckon I
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled grimly as he remembered the insolent
challenge in Carlisle&#8217;s eyes and the reference to the
bath.</p>
<p>After a time Rathburn stretched out on the bunk,
pulled his hat over his face, and dozed.</p>
<p>He sat up with a catlike movement as a persistent
tapping on the bars of his cell reached his ears.
Blinking in the half light he saw Carlisle&#8217;s dark
features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now&#8217;s your chance to smoke me up good
an&#8217; plenty an&#8217; get away with it,&#8221; said Rathburn
cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m shy my gun which the sheriff has
borrowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You figure he&#8217;s just borrowed it?&#8221; sneeringly
inquired Carlisle.</p>
<p>Rathburn rose and surveyed his visitor. &#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;ve got to tolerate you,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t pick my company in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got your number,&#8221; snarlingly replied Carlisle
in a low voice.</p>
<p>Rathburn sauntered close to the bars, rolling a
cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have, Carlisle, you&#8217;ve got a winning
number,&#8221; he said evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever your play is here, I dunno,&#8221; said
Carlisle; &#8220;but you won&#8217;t get away with it as easy
as you did over the range in Dry Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes never flickered as he coolly lit
his cigarette with a steady hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re plumb
full of information, eh, Carlisle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was over there an&#8217; heard about how you stuck
up that joint an&#8217; tried to blame it on some kid
by the name of Lamy,&#8221; said Carlisle, watching
Rathburn closely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You sure that was the way of it?&#8221; asked Rathburn
casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;I know the kid stuck
up the joint an&#8217; you took the blame to keep him
under cover. I don&#8217;t know your reasons, but I
guess you don&#8217;t want the facts known. You broke
jail. They ain&#8217;t forgot <i>that</i> over in Dry Lake.
There&#8217;s a reward out for you over there, an I
wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there was some money on
your head in Arizona, Coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes were points of red between narrowed
lids.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Coyote!&#8221; said Carlisle in a hoarse voice of
triumph. &#8220;An&#8217; the way it looks I&#8217;m the only one
hereabouts that knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you you was plumb full of information,&#8221;
said Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Coyote has a bit of a record, they tell me,&#8221;
Carlisle leered. &#8220;There&#8217;s more&#8217;n one sheriff would
pay a pretty price to get him safe, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what&#8217;s your idea in telling <i>me</i> all this,
Carlisle; why don&#8217;t you tell what you know to
Mannix, say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m just teasing you along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a chance, Carlisle. I know your breed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s face darkened, and his eyes glittered
as he peered in through the bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s <i>your</i> breed?&#8221; he asked sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to tell you that, Carlisle. You
<i>know</i>!&#8221; said Rathburn with a taunting laugh.</p>
<p>Carlisle struggled with his anger for a brief
spell. Then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to poke at you in a cage,&#8221; he said
in a more civil tone; &#8220;an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t going to tell anybody
what I know. Remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t the forgetting kind,&#8221; Rathburn flung after
him as he walked swiftly away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>Again Rathburn sat on the edge of the bunk
and smoked and thought. After a time he went to
sleep. The opening of his cell door woke him. It
was Mannix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to let me out, sheriff?&#8221; inquired Rathburn
sleepily.</p>
<p>The deputy looked at him keenly, opened the
cage, and motioned to him to follow. Rathburn
went with him out into the little office. It was
broad day. Mannix picked up a pistol from his
desk and extended it to Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your gun, Rathburn. You can go,&#8221; he
said, pressing his lips close together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, sheriff, that&#8217;s right kind of you,&#8221;
Rathburn drawled, concealing his astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t thank me,&#8221; snapped out Mannix. &#8220;This
gentleman asked me to set you loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Rathburn looked squarely at
the other man in the office&ndash;&ndash;a thin man, with a
cropped mustache, beady eyes, and a narrow face.</p>
<p>The man was regarding him intently, and there
seemed to be an amused expression in his eyes.
He turned away from Rathburn&#8217;s gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of
meeting the gentleman,&#8221; said Rathburn agreeably.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s George Sautee, manager of the Dixie
Queen,&#8221; said the deputy with a shrug.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A COMMISSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Sautee rose and extended his hand with an
affable smile. &#8220;Will you come to breakfast
with me, Mr. Rathburn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn took the hand with a curious side glance
at Mannix. &#8220;I&#8217;m powerful hungry,&#8221; he confessed;
&#8220;an&#8217; I don&#8217;t reckon I&#8217;d be showing the best of
manners if I balked at havin&#8217; breakfast with the
man that got me out of jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; admitted Sautee, winking at the
deputy. &#8220;Well, perhaps I have my reasons. All
right, Rathburn, let&#8217;s be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked out of the jail, and as they progressed
up the street they were the cynosure of
many wondering pairs of eyes; for the report had
spread that the stranger who had been jailed was
the bandit who had made away with the Dixie
Queen pay-roll on several occasions, and that he
was a gun fighter and a killer.</p>
<p>They entered a restaurant just below the hotel,
and Sautee led the way to a booth where they were
assured comparative privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ham an&#8217; eggs,&#8221; said Rathburn shortly when the
waiter entered.</p>
<p>Sautee smiled again. He was covertly inspecting
the man across the table from him and evidently
what he saw caused him to arrive at a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>
<p>He gave his order with a nod and a mild flourish
of the hand, indicating that he would take the
same.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;waiter,&#8221; called Rathburn. &#8220;Four eggs with
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee laughed. It was a peculiar laugh in that
it seemed to convey little mirth. It was perfunctory.</p>
<p>He gazed at Rathburn quizzically. &#8220;They tell
me you&#8217;re a gunman,&#8221; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s brows shot up. &#8220;They? Who&#8217;s they?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee waved a hand impatiently. &#8220;I am the
manager of the Dixie Queen. I have been around
a bit, and I have eyes. I can see. I know the
signals. I witnessed the play in the Red Feather last
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t a bad name for the place,&#8221; Rathburn
mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you suppose was my object in
getting you out of jail?&#8221; Sautee asked seriously,
leaning over the table and looking at Rathburn
searchingly. &#8220;You said last night you were a good
guesser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t say I was good at riddles,&#8221; drawled
Rathburn.</p>
<p>Sautee leaned back. For a moment there was
a gleam of admiration in his eyes. Then they
narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dixie Queen has been robbed four times
within the last year,&#8221; he said soberly. &#8220;That represents
considerable money. Yesterday I resorted to
a ruse and sent the money up with a truck driver,
but whoever is doing this thing must have got
wise somehow, for the truck driver was held up,
as you know, and the money taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not put an armed guard on that truck?&#8221;
asked Rathburn with a yawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had full confidence in that ruse, and I knew
the man who drove the truck could be trusted.
Besides, he didn&#8217;t know what was inside the package.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How much did they get?&#8221; asked Rathburn
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-two thousand eight hundred and seventy
dollars in cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn stared at the mine manager and whistled
softly. &#8220;What&#8217;s the sense in sending it up there
at all?&#8221; he asked suddenly. &#8220;Why not pay off
down here in town?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee sighed with an air of resignation. &#8220;That&#8217;s
been argued several times,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;The
men demand their pay in cash. They want it at
the mine, for more than half of them have refused
to come down here for it. It is twenty-nine miles
up there to the mine, and it would take all the
trucks we&#8217;ve got and two days to bring them down
here and take them back. Besides, if we got them
down here it would be a week before we could
get half of them back up there and at work again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why won&#8217;t they take checks?&#8221; Rathburn
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be the same proposition,&#8221; Sautee explained.
&#8220;There is a little village up there&ndash;&ndash;pool
room, soft-drink parlor, lunch room, store, and all
that&ndash;&ndash;and the men, or a large number of them,
would want their checks cashed to make purchases
and for spending money, and the cash would have
to be transported so the business places could cash
the checks. Then, there&#8217;s another reason. All the
mines over on this side of the mountains, clear
down into the desert, have always paid in cash.
This is an old district, and the matter of getting
paid in cash has become a tradition. That&#8217;s what
the company is up against. We can refuse to do
it, but all the other mines do it, and the Dixie
Queen would soon have the reputation of being the
only mine in the district that didn&#8217;t pay in cash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
The tradition is handed down from the old days
when men were paid in gold. There was a time
when a miner wouldn&#8217;t take paper money in this
country!&#8221;</p>
<p>The waiter entered with the breakfast dishes and
they began to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mine owned by a stock company?&#8221; Rathburn
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Sautee. &#8220;All the mines here
are. What mine isn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn ignored the question. &#8220;Stockholders live
aroun&#8217; here?&#8221; he asked, between mouthfuls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;no, that is, not many,&#8221; replied Sautee with
a quick glance at his questioner. &#8220;This district is
pretty well worked out. Most of our stockholders
live in the Middle West and the East.&#8221; He winked
at Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any other mines been robbed?&#8221; Rathburn persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s the funny part of it. Still&ndash;&ndash;no, it <i>isn&#8217;t</i>
funny. We&#8217;re working on the largest scale, and
our pay-roll is, naturally, the largest. It furnishes
the biggest incentive. In addition, the Dixie Queen
is the farthest out from town, and there are many
excellent spots for a holdup between town and
the mine. Oh, don&#8217;t look skeptical. I&#8217;ve tried
trusted messengers by roundabout trails, and guards
and all that. They even held up a convoy on one
occasion. I&#8217;ve set traps. I&#8217;ve done everything.
But now I&#8217;ve a new idea, and I believe it&#8217;ll work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He finished his breakfast and stared steadily at
Rathburn who didn&#8217;t look up, but leisurely drank
a second cup of coffee. Sautee noted the slim,
tapered right hand of the man across the table from
him, the clear, gray eyes, the unmistakable poise
of a man who is absolutely and utterly confident
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and sure of himself. The mine manager&#8217;s eyes
glowed eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked Rathburn calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to hire, or, rather, I&#8217;m going to <i>try</i>
to hire a man I believe is just as tough, just as
clever, just as quick with his gun as the men
who&#8217;ve been robbing the Dixie Queen. I&#8217;m going
to hire him to carry the money to the mine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So <i>that&#8217;s</i> why you got me out of jail,&#8221; said Rathburn,
drawing the inevitable tobacco and papers from
his shirt pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; whispered Sautee eagerly. &#8220;I want you for
the job!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t forgetting that I was suspected of
that last job, are you? That&#8217;s why I went to
jail, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to go to jail unless you wanted
to. You didn&#8217;t have to stop in this town and
invite arrest. Mannix let you go up there yesterday
because he felt sure he could get you when he
wanted you again, and he figured you&#8217;d make some
break that would give him a clew to your pals,
if you had any. You went to jail because you
knew he didn&#8217;t have anything on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee grinned in triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I won&#8217;t beat it with the
money?&#8221; asked Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Sautee quickly. &#8220;But I&#8217;m taking
a chance on it that you won&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t care who
you are, what you are now, or what you&#8217;ve been;
I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re an outlaw! I figure, Rathburn,
that if I come out square and trust you
with this mission and depend upon you to carry
it out, that you&#8217;ll play square with me. That&#8217;s what
I&#8217;m banking on&ndash;&ndash;your own sense of squareness.
You&#8217;ve got it, for I can see it in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Carlisle?&#8221; Rathburn asked dryly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>Sautee frowned. &#8220;He&#8217;s a&ndash;&ndash;well, I guess you&#8217;d
call him a sort of adventurer. I knew him down
in Arizona. He follows the camps when they&#8217;re
good, and this one happens to be good right now,
for we&#8217;re improving the property. That&#8217;s how he
happened to come up here about a year ago. Then,
when the first robbery occurred, I engaged him as
a sort of special agent. He didn&#8217;t make any progress,
so I let him go. Since then he&#8217;s been out and in,
gambling, prospecting, anything&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s a fast man
with his gun, and he has some claims here which
he is developing on a small scale and trying to sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded but made no comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take the job?&#8221; Sautee asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to carry a sum of money to the
mine. I&#8217;m not going to tell you how much, but
it will be considerable. The money which was
stolen yesterday was for the pay-off to-day. I&#8217;ve
got to get the cash for the men up there quick.
They all know about the holdup, so there&#8217;s no
grumbling&ndash;&ndash;yet. But there will be if they don&#8217;t
have their money pretty quick. We want to pay
off to-morrow. I could go with a guard, but to
tell you the truth, Rathburn, it&#8217;s got to a point
where I can&#8217;t trust a soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not Mannix?&#8221; asked Rathburn sharply.</p>
<p>Sautee shook his head; his beady, black eyes
glowed, and he stroked his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another sorrowful point,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I tell you we&#8217;re up against it here, Rathburn. The
Dixie Queen people and most of the other mines
are fighting the present county administration as a
matter of policy. They want certain changes, and&ndash;&ndash;well,
keep this to yourself&ndash;&ndash;privileges. Mannix has
been instructed by the sheriff of this county that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
is not here to act as a guard for the Dixie Queen.
See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn frowned and built another cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll carry this package of money up to
the Dixie Queen for me, Rathburn, I&#8217;ll pay you five
hundred dollars. Then, if you want to stay and
act as our messenger right along, we&#8217;ll make a
deal. But I&#8217;d like to have you do this this time&ndash;&ndash;make
this one trip, anyway, I mean. They may
try to stop you. If they do I don&#8217;t believe they
can get away with it. I&#8217;m banking on your ability
to get through, and I think the proposition will
appeal to you in a sporting way if for no other
reason. Will you do it?&#8221; Sautee&#8217;s eyes were eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rathburn shortly, tossing away his
cigarette.</p>
<p>Sautee held out his hand. &#8220;Go to the hotel and
engage a room,&#8221; he instructed. &#8220;Be in your room
at nine o&#8217;clock to-night. Do not tell any one of
our deal. I&#8217;ll get your room number from the
register. I&#8217;ll bring the package of money to you
between nine o&#8217;clock and midnight. Now, Rathburn,
maybe I&#8217;m mistaken in you; but I go a whole
lot by what I see in a man&#8217;s eyes. You may have a
hard record, but I&#8217;m staking my faith in men
on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; Rathburn promised.</p>
<p>He left Sautee at the entrance to the restaurant
and strolled around the hotel barn to see that his
horse was being taken care of properly. He found
that the barn man was indeed looking after the
dun in excellent shape. Rathburn spent a short
time with his mount, petting him and rubbing his
glossy coat with his hands. Then he took his slicker
pack and started for the hotel.</p>
<p>As he reached the street he saw a girl on a
horse talking with a man on the sidewalk. The girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
was leaning over, and the man evidently was delivering
a harangue. He was gesticulating wildly, and
Rathburn could see that the girl was cowering. He
paused on the hotel porch as the man stepped away
from the horse and looked his way. He recognized
Carlisle.</p>
<p>Then the girl rode down the street and Rathburn
started with surprise as he saw she was the girl
from the cabin up the road who had directed him
to town the day before. He remembered the two
objects he had picked up in the road after the
holdup and felt in his pocket to make sure they
were there. Then he entered the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a room?&#8221; he asked the clerk pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. More rooms than anything else to-day
since the Sunday crowd&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn wrote his name upon the register.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE NIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn avoided the Red Feather resort during
the morning. Instead of walking about the
streets or sitting in the hotel lobby or his room,
he cultivated the acquaintance of the barn man,
and because he knew horses&ndash;&ndash;<i>all</i> about horses&ndash;&ndash;he
soon had the man&#8217;s attention and respect.</p>
<p>Although Rathburn suspected that he already had
a reputation in the town, he did not know that
Carlisle was steadily adding to that reputation through
the medium of veiled hints dropped here and there
until a majority of the population was convinced
that a desperate man was in their midst, and that
Mannix had permitted him to go free for certain
secret reasons.</p>
<p>Thus a web of mystery and suspicion was cleverly
woven about Rathburn&#8217;s movements.</p>
<p>It was not until afternoon, however, that Rathburn
began to realize on his intimacy with the
barn man. Then they began to talk of trails, and
for more than an hour the barn man, caught in
the spell of Rathburn&#8217;s personality, divulged the
secret of the trails leading to and from the Dixie
Queen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best trail, an&#8217; the straightest, if you should
ever want to go up there an&#8217; look at the mine
like you say,&#8221; said the barn man, &#8220;hits into the
timber behind the first cabin to the left above town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded smilingly. It was the cabin
where he had first seen the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;bout twenty-nine miles to the mine by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
road,&#8221; the man explained; &#8220;but that trail will take
you there in less&#8217;n twenty. Well, maybe twenty or
twenty-one. Or you can go up the road till you
get to the big hogback&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s where they held up
the truck driver yesterday&ndash;&ndash;and cut straight up the
hill from the south end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess those are the best trails from what you
say,&#8221; was Rathburn&#8217;s yawning comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s the best,&#8221; the other added. &#8220;There&#8217;s
another trail going out below town that follows
southeast along a big ridge, but that trail&#8217;s as far
as the road. When you goin&#8217; up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; replied Rathburn noncommittally. &#8220;Say,
I guess I know where that cabin is on the left
side of the road going up. I stopped at a cabin
up there coming down an&#8217; asked a gal how far it
was to town&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the barn man. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one.
Trail starts right back of that cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn yawned again. &#8220;Smart-lookin&#8217; gal,&#8221; he
observed, digging for his tobacco and papers. &#8220;Who
is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Joe Carlisle&#8217;s sister. Anyway, he says
she is. There&#8217;s been some talk. Carlisle lives there
when he ain&#8217;t out in the hills or on a gamblin&#8217;
trip to some other town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Well, old-timer, I ain&#8217;t hung on the
feed bag since morning, an&#8217; I&#8217;m going on a still
hunt for some grub.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn went to the Red Feather for his dinner.
He was thoughtful through the meal and kept an
eye out for Carlisle, but didn&#8217;t see him. During
the remainder of the afternoon he hung about the
Red Feather and other resorts, but did not see
Carlisle.</p>
<p>That evening, as he was returning to the hotel,
he met Mannix. The deputy looked at him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
a scowl in which there was a mixture of curiosity.
Rathburn suddenly remembered what Sautee had
said about his company being on the outs with the
county administration. If such was the case, Rathburn
reflected, how did it come that Sautee had
been able to effect his release so easily?</p>
<p>He stopped as he drew alongside of the deputy.
&#8220;This man Sautee,&#8221; he drawled, looking Mannix
square in the eye; &#8220;he must have a good drag
with the county seat, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy&#8217;s scowl deepened. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t get
you out by word of mouth alone,&#8221; he said sharply.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got anything on you, Rathburn&ndash;&ndash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn smiled. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re a sheriff after
my own heart,&#8221; he said enigmatically, and moved on.</p>
<p>Mannix looked back after him for a moment,
then continued on his way.</p>
<p>Rathburn had dinner that night at the hotel, and
it was during the course of a number of pleasantries
with the waitress, who thought he was looking for
work, that he ascertained that Sautee had a little
two-room building at the lower end of the street,
the front half of which served as an office and the
rear half as living quarters.</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock he went to his room. He lighted
the oil lamp, pulled down the window shade, sat
down in a chair to one side of the door to wait.
An hour passed with no sound save occasional footfalls
in the hall and the drone of the wind in the
trees outside.</p>
<p>Another hour had nearly been consumed in waiting
when Rathburn heard some one coming up the stairs.
The footfalls were soft, catlike. He could hardly
hear them, and it was this fact which made him
instantly alert. The footfalls now sounded in the
hallway. They were nearer his room. He rose;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
stepped close to the side of the door. Then came
a soft knock.</p>
<p>Rathburn suddenly opened the door, and Sautee
started back, blinking his eyes. The mines manager
peered about the room, then entered swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You rather startled me,&#8221; he accused with a
forced smile.</p>
<p>Rathburn closed the door softly and turned the
key in the lock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just taking natural precautions,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Sautee shook his head and put a finger to his
lips. &#8220;Not so loud,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;These walls&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
waved a hand about&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;are all ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a package from beneath his coat and
handed it to Rathburn. &#8220;Put it in your shirt,&#8221; he
instructed. &#8220;Deliver it to the office at the mine
and take the bookkeeper&#8217;s receipt. Then report to
my office here in town. I wish you luck, and I
want you to know that I have the utmost confidence
in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep such large sums on hand all the time?&#8221;
Rathburn asked, putting the package in his shirt.
He was mindful of the fact that a similar sum
had been stolen the day before from the truck
driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a private bank here,&#8221; answered Sautee
frowningly. &#8220;He let me have it, but he&#8217;s already
sent to the county seat for more cash which will
come by auto express to-morrow, probably. Anyway,
the bank&#8217;ll get most of this back, so their
cash won&#8217;t be short long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;There was a little item of five hundred between
us for my serving&ndash;&ndash;am I right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is such an item,&#8221; snapped out Sautee;
&#8220;when you&#8217;ve delivered.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Rathburn. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t expect
to be paid in advance. I&#8217;m to deliver the money
at the mine and report to you for the five hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Sautee. &#8220;Which way you figure
on going up?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know much about the trails,&#8221; Rathburn
answered. &#8220;An&#8217; it mightn&#8217;t attract suspicion if I
just struck right out on the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee shrugged. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Keep your eye peeled. I don&#8217;t think any
one knows I drew that money from the bank, but
I didn&#8217;t think any one knew I stuck that package
under the truck driver&#8217;s seat, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just one other little matter,&#8221; said Rathburn
softly. &#8220;You see nobody knows anything about
this deal but you an&#8217; me. Maybe it would be best
for my own protection that you scribbled something
on a piece of paper to show what our arrangement
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee scowled again, hesitated, then smiled. He
drew an envelope from a pocket, extracted its contents,
tore it open at each end, and wrote on the
blank side:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due Rathburn five hundred dollars when he
has delivered package intrusted to him by me
at the Dixie Queen mine office.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>George Sautee.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rathburn nodded in satisfaction as he took the
slip of paper and tucked it into his shirt pocket.
The wording of the note was a bit complicated, but
it bore Sautee&#8217;s signature. It was at least evidence
that there <i>had</i> been an agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything set?&#8221; asked Sautee.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All cinched up an&#8217; ready to go,&#8221; replied Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon you going to start?&#8221; asked Sautee
as he unlocked the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;By midnight,&#8221; Rathburn answered.</p>
<p>Sautee held out his hand before he slipped out of
the door and was gone.</p>
<p>Rathburn quickly busied himself with his slicker
pack. He took out a gun which he changed for the
gun in his holster. Then he stuck his regular gun
into his waistband on the left. He took out the
package and examined it. It was sealed at each
end. Then Rathburn did a queer thing. He cut
the string and paper near the seals and removed
the small box within. He next emptied the box
of its paper-wrapped contents and substituted the
first thing of equal weight which he could lay his
hands on&ndash;&ndash;a moleskin glove which was among the
things in the slicker pack. He replaced the box
in its wrappings and drew from one of his pockets
a small bottle of glue.</p>
<p>&#8220;First time I ever stole anything from a hotel
desk,&#8221; he muttered to himself as he glued the paper
back into place; &#8220;but I sure had the proper hunch
when I grabbed this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next he retied the string, adding a piece from
his slicker pack to offset the shortness where it had
been cut. When he had finished the package looked
exactly as it had in the first place. It would take
a close inspection to learn that it had been tampered
with. The original contents of the package he
thrust into his hat and pulled the hat well down
on his head.</p>
<p>Then he extinguished the light and made his
way downstairs and out the lobby into the street.
He went quickly around to the barn where he astonished
the man in charge by saddling his horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and riding out without a word of explanation other
than to toss him a five-dollar bill from the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you again to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;maybe,&#8221; he called,
grinning, as he rode into the night.</p>
<p>When Rathburn had passed behind the hotel
and several other buildings on the same side of
the street and gained the road leading westward
toward the hogback, a slim shadow darted out
of the trees, mounted a horse concealed some distance
behind the barn, and slipped into a worn trail
which nearly paralleled the road going west.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>QUICK TURNS</h3>
</div>
<p>As he rode westward along the road at a swinging
lope, Rathburn made no apparent effort to
conceal his movements. The night sky was bright
with stars, and, although the moon was not up,
the road was clearly outlined through the marching
stands of timber as he swung upward past the cabin
where he had met the girl said to be Carlisle&#8217;s sister.</p>
<p>Rathburn could not forget the look on the girl&#8217;s
face when she had asked him about the activities
of the officer in the automobile. Nor could he
forget the expression in her eyes during her altercation
with Carlisle that day.</p>
<p>After he had passed the cabin, Rathburn checked
his pace and proceeded more slowly up the long
stretches of road to the hogback. On the hogback
he began to take advantage of the screen of timber
on the lower side of the road, and to ride more
cautiously. However, to any one who might have
been watching, his movements still would have been
easily discernible, and it would have appeared that
he wasn&#8217;t quite sure of himself. Twice he turned
off at what he appeared to think was the beginning
of a trail, and both times he again turned back
to the road.</p>
<p>Then, as he reached the south end of the hogback
where the trail left the road and cut straight
across to the mine, two horsemen broke from the
timber, and Rathburn reined in his horse as the
guns which covered him glinted.</p>
<p>The taller of the pair of night riders kept him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
covered with two guns while the other rode in
close and jerked the weapon from his holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon with the package!&#8221; said this man in a
hoarse voice. &#8220;We won&#8217;t take a chance on you.
If you make any kind of a break you&#8217;ll get it
where it&#8217;ll do most good.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sneering inflection in the voice.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s hand, as it moved downward toward
his shirt, hovered an instant above where his good
gun was stuck in his waistband, out of sight under
the skirt of his coat; then it moved to the open shirt
at his throat. He drew out the package and held
it out toward the other.</p>
<p>The man closed in and snatched the package,
glancing at it in the dim starlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now back the way you came an&#8217; don&#8217;t invite no
shootin&#8217;!&#8221; was the brief command.</p>
<p>Rathburn whirled his horse and drove in his
spurs. As he fled from the scene a harsh laugh
came to his ears from behind. Then utter silence
save for the pounding of his horse&#8217;s hoofs in the
hard road back down the hogback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jog along, hoss,&#8221; Rathburn crooned as he sped
down the long slopes toward town; &#8220;maybe we&#8217;re
peggin&#8217; things wrong, an&#8217; if it turns out that way
we&#8217;ve a powerful long ways to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>It lacked a few minutes of being two hours
after midnight when he reached the Carlisle cabin.
There he reined in his horse, dismounted in the
shadow of the timber, and crept to a window. The
moon had risen and was bathing the hills in a
ghostly light in which every object stood out clear-cut
and easily distinguishable. Rathburn peered into
the two front windows, but could see nothing. Then,
from a side window into which the moonlight filtered,
he made out a bedroom. It was not occupied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
From the other side of the cabin he saw another
bedroom, and it, too, was unoccupied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody home,&#8221; he muttered cheerfully as he ran
for his horse.</p>
<p>In another minute he was again speeding down
the road toward town. He slacked his pace as he
reached the upper end of the short main street.
The street was dark save for two beams of yellow
light, one of which shone from a window of the
jail office and the other from the front of the
Red Feather resort.</p>
<p>He walked his horse down the street past the
jail and the resort and almost to the end of the
line of buildings where he arrived before the small,
one-story, two-room structure which was Sautee&#8217;s
office and abode.</p>
<p>The place was dark. Rathburn dismounted and
led his horse into the dark shadow at the side of
the little building. Then he went around to the
front, and, drawing his gun from his waistband, he
rapped smartly on the door with its butt and dropped
it into his holster.</p>
<p>There was no movement within, and Rathburn
rapped again and tried the door. It was locked.</p>
<p>A match flared into flame somewhere beyond the
front room. A glow of light followed. Rathburn,
looking through the front window, saw a door open
wide and made out the form of Sautee as the
mines manager came forward to the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Sautee called cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rathburn.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment a key turned in the lock and
the door opened part way. Rathburn pushed his
way in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;didn&#8217;t you <i>go</i>?&#8221; asked Sautee in excited
tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lock the door an&#8217; come in the other room,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
whispered Rathburn. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to tell
you that&#8217;ll knock you for a goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee hurriedly locked the door, and, as he
turned to lead the way into the other room, Rathburn
deftly extracted the key.</p>
<p>In the light from the lamp in the bedroom Sautee
swung on his visitor and looked at him keenly.
The mines manager was fully dressed, and the
bed was made. It was evident that he had merely
dozed on top of the covers with his clothes on.
These things Rathburn noted even as Sautee surveyed
him with a frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; snapped out Sautee.</p>
<p>Rathburn blinked in the light. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I was held
up,&#8221; he said sheepishly.</p>
<p>The mines manager stared. First he stared into
Rathburn&#8217;s eyes, and then he glanced to the gun
in the holster on his thigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have been very much afraid of you,&#8221; he
said sneeringly. &#8220;I see they didn&#8217;t even take your
gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It all come from my not knowin&#8217; enough about
the trails, I guess,&#8221; Rathburn explained lamely.
&#8220;Got me on the far end of the hogback. Two of
&#8217;em. Had their guns in my face before I knew it.
Couldn&#8217;t have drawed if I wanted to. They&#8217;d have
shot me out of the saddle in a wink. All I could
do was hand over the package an&#8217; beat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they said you were a gunman,&#8221; said Sautee
in derision. &#8220;How do <i>I</i> know anybody stopped you
and robbed you? Maybe you&#8217;ve come back here
with that story to cover up the theft of the money.
I guess I made a mistake in ever thinking of trusting
a man of your caliber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of that,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;I was
afraid if anything like this was to happen you
might think I was lying and was taking the money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
myself. But I fooled &#8217;em, Mr. Sautee,&#8221; he finished
in triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Sautee asked sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; cried Rathburn excitedly as he took
off his hat and recovered the package he had put
in it before starting toward the mine.</p>
<p>He held up the package. &#8220;I was scared they
might get wise an&#8217; get the drop on me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;So I opened the package an&#8217; took out what was in
it and put it in my hat. They got the original
package, all right, but it was stuffed with an old
glove of mine. Here&#8217;s the money. I didn&#8217;t go
right on to the mine for fear they&#8217;d find out their
mistake an&#8217; pot me from the timber. This is the
money you gave me, minus the seals an&#8217; the string
an&#8217; box. I wanted you to see that I was on the
square.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s eyes were bulging. &#8220;Give me that,&#8221; he
gulped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you want me to take it to the mine?&#8221;
asked Rathburn in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand that over,&#8221; ordered Sautee, reaching for
the package.</p>
<p>Rathburn drew away. &#8220;All right, Mr. Sautee,&#8221;
he said in a complaining voice. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want
me to go through with the job you can back down,
I guess. We&#8217;ll just make sure the money&#8217;s here,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee leaped toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me that package!&#8221; he cried angrily. &#8220;Do
you hear me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn warded him off, keeping the package
at arm&#8217;s length away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just hold your horses,&#8221; he said coldly. &#8220;I
reckon I know what I&#8217;m doing. You don&#8217;t trust
me now, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to take any chances with
you. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to open this an&#8217; show you that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
the money&#8217;s there, that&#8217;s all; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to show you
that I&#8217;m giving you back what you gave me all
fair an&#8217; square.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s face was ashen. His voice trembled as
he spoke again: &#8220;Hand it over and get out of
here. I&#8217;ve had enough trouble with you. I&#8217;ll take
your word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rathburn was undoing the paper wrappings.</p>
<p>Again Sautee made a leap, but this time he met
Rathburn&#8217;s left fist and staggered back, dropping
into a chair. Rathburn looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny you&#8217;re so anxious to take my word for
things now, when a minute ago you said you
couldn&#8217;t know but what I&#8217;d told that holdup story
for a blind so&#8217;s I could get away with&ndash;&ndash;<i>this</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>The wrappings fell away, revealing a wad of blank
paper.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s face froze. Sautee stared white-faced
at what the other held in his hand. Then a peculiar
glint came into his eyes and he looked at Rathburn
narrowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the way of it,&#8221; he said sarcastically.</p>
<p>Rathburn stuffed the paper into a pocket. Then
he pulled a chair in front of the mines manager and
sat down. He took out paper and tobacco from his
shirt pocket and began to fashion a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure looks bad for me, doesn&#8217;t it, Mr. Sautee?&#8221;
he asked as he snapped a match into flame.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going to return the money,&#8221;
Sautee said sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks bad two ways,&#8221; Rathburn went on as if
he hadn&#8217;t heard the other&#8217;s comment. &#8220;First, if
that package the holdups got had contained the
money you could have swore it was a put-up job.
I&#8217;d have had to beat it fast. Now, when I find
that the package you gave to me was full of
blank paper, you can say that I framed the holdup
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
story and changed the money for paper in the
bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s eyes were glowing. &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll have to
beat it, after all,&#8221; he jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it would seem,&#8221; mused Rathburn. &#8220;I fooled
&#8217;em, an&#8217; to all appearances I fooled myself, although
maybe I <i>did</i> take a peep into that package when I
changed it in my room, Mr. Sautee.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mines manager shifted in his chair; but he
stared defiantly at Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have a hard time proving anything,&#8221; he
said grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; Rathburn admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;d
sort of have to depend on you. I was thinkin&#8217;
maybe you double crossed me to make &#8217;em think
<i>I</i> was carrying the money while you sneaked it up
some other way, Mr. Sautee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can think what you want to,&#8221; said Sautee.
&#8220;But you better start moving. If I was you, I&#8217;d
get as far away from this town and Mannix as I
could by daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s manner underwent a lightning change
as he threw away his partly finished cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said crisply. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to start
moving, Sautee.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose, and his right hand moved incredibly
fast. Sautee gasped as he looked into the bore of
Rathburn&#8217;s gun. He could hardly realize that Rathburn
had drawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fooled the night riders twice,&#8221; explained Rathburn
with a peculiar smile. &#8220;First, when I let &#8217;em
get the wrong package, an&#8217; again when I let &#8217;em
get the wrong gun. This gun an&#8217; I work together
like clock ticks when necessary. I&#8217;ll have to ask
you to fork over the money that you drew from
the bank an&#8217; that should have been in that package,
Sautee.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes had narrowed and hardened; his
words were cold and menacing&ndash;&ndash;deadly in their
absolute sincerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what do you mean?&#8221; stammered the mines
manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take it you&#8217;re not deaf,&#8221; snapped out Rathburn.
&#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t know it, Sautee, but so
help me, you&#8217;re takin&#8217; a chance by acting like you
didn&#8217;t get me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s thin face was twitching in a spasm of
commingled rage and fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Coyote!&#8221; he breathed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; demanded Rathburn on
the instant.</p>
<p>Sautee gripped the sides of his chair, and his
face went a shade more pallid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlisle,&#8221; he confessed in a strained voice.</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed, and the mines manager shivered
as he heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Sautee, we&#8217;ll quit beatin&#8217; around the bush,&#8221;
Rathburn said through his teeth. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get down
to business together, or I&#8217;ll begin to search your
place here. But if I have to search, I&#8217;ll search
alone. There ain&#8217;t so much chance of a shot bein&#8217;
heard way up the street; an&#8217; there ain&#8217;t much
chance of me bein&#8217; caught on that hoss of mine
if I don&#8217;t want to get caught. Also, I&#8217;m beginning
to feel like I was in a hurry. Fork over that
money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee looked just an instant longer into the
eyes of the man towering over him. Then he
rose, shaking, dry-lipped, and knelt down by the
head of the bed. He lifted a piece of the carpet,
opened a small trapdoor, reached inside, and brought
out a bundle of bank notes. Rathburn took the
money from him.</p>
<p>Sautee still was kneeling as he heard Rathburn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
walk lightly to the front door and insert the key
in the lock. He tried to cry out, but the effort
resulted only in a croak in his throat. He heard
the door close softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Coyote!&#8221; he mumbled, passing a hand across
his forehead.</p>
<p>The echoes of galloping hoofs came to him as he
scrambled to his feet and staggered toward the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>APPEAL TO THE LAW</h3>
</div>
<p>For some moments Sautee stood in the darkened
doorway staring up the moonlit street. The
echoes of Rathburn&#8217;s flight had died away. The
town was still. Sautee did not cry out, although
he had recovered a considerable measure of his
composure. He listened intently and finally grunted
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the road,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;That means he is
making for the pass over the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked hurriedly through his office into the
living room. There he stood for a spell beside the
table on which burned the lamp. His brows were
knit into a heavy frown. He seemed debating a
question in his mind. He tapped with nervous
fingers on the table top.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw,&#8221; he said aloud, his face darkening. &#8220;He&#8217;s
an outlaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put on his coat and dropped an automatic
pistol into a side pocket. After another moment of
hesitation he blew out the light and walked quickly
out of the place, locking the door after him.</p>
<p>He hurried up the street to the jail. He found
the jailer dozing in the little front office and did
not attempt to disturb him. From the jail he hurried
another short distance up the street and turned in
at a little house located some distance back from
the sidewalk. He knocked loudly on the door, and
after a brief wait repeated the performance.</p>
<p>A light showed, and the front door opened. Mannix,
the deputy, looked out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let me in,&#8221; said Sautee briefly. &#8220;There&#8217;s been
another robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix swung the door wide and stepped aside.
He wore an ulster over his night clothes, and his
bare feet were thrust into slippers. He scowled at
the mines manager as he shut the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;More of the company&#8217;s money gone?&#8221; he asked
with a touch of sarcasm in his voice.</p>
<p>Sautee nodded. &#8220;Some twenty-odd thousand,&#8221; he
said soberly; &#8220;and I believe the man that got it is
responsible for the holdups that have been pulled
off around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who got it?&#8221; Mannix asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rathburn,&#8221; Sautee announced.</p>
<p>Mannix smiled in undisgusted contempt. &#8220;Your
own fault,&#8221; he pointed out. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t give me a
chance to investigate. Said you had a scheme that
would show him up one way or the other. Wouldn&#8217;t
let me in on it, an&#8217; I was fool enough to let you
have a try, although I don&#8217;t believe I could have
held him anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just it,&#8221; said Sautee. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t have done any
good to keep him in jail, and I thought I had a
two-way scheme that would either show him up,
as you say, or get me an excellent messenger. I
intrusted Rathburn with a package to carry to the
mines office. He&#8217;s a gunman, a desperado, probably
a killer, and I thought it would appeal to him
to be put in a place of trust. If he fell down&ndash;&ndash;then
I figured you&#8217;d be able to get him like you
said you could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix snorted. &#8220;After tryin&#8217; a fool scheme
you want to shift the business on <i>my</i> shoulders, eh?
Well, Sautee, you&#8217;ve never shown much confidence
in my ability, an&#8217; you don&#8217;t have to show any
now. It looks to me as if the finishing of this
play is all up to you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Sautee confidently. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
be most mighty glad to take out after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you wait an&#8217; see how quick I start,&#8221;
Mannix retorted angrily. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?
Didn&#8217;t he carry out your orders? I suppose you
gave him a bundle of money to make off with.
Sautee, I believe you&#8217;re a fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>The mines manager winced and then frowned.
&#8220;I gave him the money to carry to the mine,&#8221; he
confessed without flinching. &#8220;He came back with
a story about being held up, and when he saw that
I didn&#8217;t believe him and intended to turn him back
to you, he pulled a gun on me and made his get-away.
He lit out through town for the road to
the hogback and the pass over the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix laughed harshly. &#8220;You&#8217;re clever, Sautee;
there&#8217;s no getting away from how clever you are.
Now you want me to go chasing up to the hogback
to head him off. Well, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you that
I don&#8217;t know where he&#8217;s gone, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t starting
out after him at any two o&#8217;clock in the morning.
If you&#8217;d have kept your nose out of this he&#8217;d
still be all safe an&#8217; quiet in jail. That&#8217;s final, so
you might as well clear out an&#8217; give me a chance
to get some sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee merely smiled after this speech from the
disgusted deputy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I intrusted Rathburn with that job I&#8217;ve
found out something about him which takes the
case out of my hands entirely,&#8221; he said with a
smirk. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if you don&#8217;t start after him
till day after to-morrow. But if your chief&ndash;&ndash;the
sheriff&ndash;&ndash;finds out that you didn&#8217;t hit the trail to-night
he&#8217;ll likely ask you for your badge!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you threatening me?&#8221; Mannix demanded
loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m only stating facts,&#8221; Sautee replied stoutly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
&#8220;That man who calls himself Rathburn is The
Coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix didn&#8217;t start. He appeared hardly interested.
Only the keen, penetrating quality of the
steady gaze he directed at the mines manager betrayed
the fact that his faculties were aroused.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Coyote hit back for Arizona after that
deal he was mixed up in over in Dry Lake, across
the range,&#8221; he said with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he did?&#8221; Sautee sneered openly. &#8220;Well,
you had him in jail last night, and you can probably
get him again, if you start right out after
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think this fellow Rathburn is
The Coyote?&#8221; demanded Mannix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carlisle knows him by sight, and he told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221; the deputy asked
sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Carlisle didn&#8217;t tell me until after I
told him what I&#8217;d done,&#8221; Sautee evaded. &#8220;Then I
didn&#8217;t have the&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;nerve, under the circumstances,
to come to you with the news. At that, I thought
he might go through with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix swore softly. &#8220;Giving a pay-roll messenger&#8217;s
job to a man who&#8217;s got a price on his
head a mile long!&#8221; he exclaimed savagely. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t Carlisle come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee shrugged. &#8220;I&#8217;m not responsible for Carlisle.
Maybe he didn&#8217;t feel sure of it, and maybe
he&#8217;s just naturally jealous of The Coyote and wants
to bring him in himself. Carlisle is a gunman, as
you know, and a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; snapped out Mannix; &#8220;and I know
both Carlisle an&#8217; you are a pair of bunglers. I guess
you wanted to show me up, but you&#8217;ve gone about
it in a way that won&#8217;t get you anything nor hurt
me, I&#8217;ll see to that.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>Sautee smiled as the deputy hurried out of the
room.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Mannix returned fully dressed
and carrying a rifle. The deputy&#8217;s face was severe,
and his eyes burned with the fire of the man
hunt. He signaled impatiently to the mine manager
to follow him. As they walked across the little
porch and around to the rear of the house where
Mannix kept his car the deputy talked fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; up to the hogback. He ain&#8217;t had start
enough to get up there yet on a horse, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
beat him to it. It&#8217;ll be daylight in about two
hours, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be there till daylight. If you think
you can do it, get out some of the men an&#8217; cover
the trails to the mine on horses. He might try
to get over that way. Then you better take your
car and go up to the mine by the road as fast
as you can to tell &#8217;em to be on the lookout. Watch
out on the hogback, for I&#8217;ll be up there, parked with
my lights out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had reached his small garage when he finished
giving his instructions, and Sautee, with a promise
to do as he had been told as quickly as possible,
ran down the street toward the Red Feather, where
a light still shone.</p>
<p>The news that The Coyote and Rathburn were
one and the same, and that he had robbed the
mining company that night and was probably responsible
for the other holdups, created an immediate
sensation among the few gamblers in the resort.
Sautee added to the excitement by quoting rewards
at random, and the forming of two posses to comb
the trails to the mine and beyond was under way
at once.</p>
<p>Sautee ran to his office and got out his small
car. He stopped at the Red Feather and took one
of the men from the mine with him. He stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
again when he reached the Carlisle cabin, pounded
on the doors, and looked in the windows. But
the place was deserted, and Sautee&#8217;s features were
wreathed in perplexity as he went back to his car.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer,&#8221; he said as he climbed into his
seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the man beside him.</p>
<p>But Sautee&#8217;s answer was drowned in the roar
of the motor as he sped up the road toward the
hogback and the mine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A CAPTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>When Rathburn rode away from Sautee&#8217;s
quarters he galloped up the street straight
for the road which led west out of town. He
pulled his horse down to a trot when he reached
the Carlisle cabin and made another brief inspection
which showed that the place was deserted. Then
he struck into the trail behind the cabin and began
the ascent toward the Dixie Queen.</p>
<p>He rode slowly through the timber, depending
upon his mount to keep to the dim trail, but in
the open stretches in meadows and on the crest
of ridges where the timber thinned, he made better
time. On this occasion one would not have
noted an attitude of uncertainty about his manner
or movements. He had paid strict attention to the
barn man&#8217;s description of this trail, and he had
determined general directions the day before. Rathburn
was not a stranger to the art of following new
trails; nor was he the kind to become confused in
a locality with which he was not familiar unless
he became absolutely lost. In this instance it would
be a hard matter to become lost, for the ridges
rose steadily upward toward the summits of the
high mountains, the town was in the narrow valley
below, and the foothills ranged down to the desert
in the east.</p>
<p>He was halfway to the mine when he saw the
gleam of an automobile&#8217;s lights in the road far
below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sautee got busy right quick,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
&#8217;spect they&#8217;re hustlin&#8217; up to head me off at the hogback.
They&#8217;re figuring I&#8217;d try to go back the way
I come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled grimly in the soft moonlight, and his
gaze turned toward the east, where the stars glowed
over the shadowy reaches of desert which he could
not see, but the very thought of which stirred something
in his soul.</p>
<p>Then he pushed on up the trail toward the mine.
For more than an hour he rode, and then, when
he came to the crest of a ridge just below the
Dixie Queen, he saw the lights of an automobile
in the road to the right of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t figurin&#8217;
I&#8217;d come up here!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat his horse with features again wreathed
in perplexity. He scowled at the approaching gleam
of light. In the direction of the hogback he could
see nothing. Nor could he see the horsemen already
on the trail below him and on the ridge trail
to eastward.</p>
<p>The little mine village was directly below him.
The few buildings huddled together below the big
mine dump were dark. The mine buildings, too,
were dark. A faint glow showed in the east&ndash;&ndash;harbinger
of the dawn.</p>
<p>The left side of the automobile was toward him
when it stopped in the little street below. A man
climbed out and walked around in front of the
car, and Rathburn grunted in recognition as he
made out the familiar form of Sautee, the mine
manager.</p>
<p>He saw Sautee and another leave the car and
walk toward a building at the lower end of the
street. He could see them fairly well in the moonlight
and realized that in a comparatively short time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
it would be daylight. He turned his horse down
the slope.</p>
<p>When he reached the rear of the few buildings
which formed the mining village, catering to the
wants of the Dixie Queen workers, Rathburn edged
along to the lower end where he left his horse in
the shadow of a building directly across from the
one which Sautee and his companion had entered,
and in the windows of which a light now shone.</p>
<p>He stole across the street. Peering in one of
the windows he saw that the room was an office.
Sautee was standing before a desk, talking to another
man. Rathburn quickly surmised that this
man had accompanied Sautee from the town. Even
as he looked, Sautee finished his speech by striking
a palm with his fist, and his companion strode toward
the door.</p>
<p>Rathburn darted around the side of the building
into the shadow as the man came out and hurried
up a wide road toward the mine buildings above.
Then Rathburn ran around to the front of the
building and quietly opened the door.</p>
<p>Sautee had seated himself at the desk, and he
swung about in his chair as he heard the door
open. He looked again into the black bore of
Rathburn&#8217;s gun. His eyes bulged, and this time
they shone with genuine terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was sure in the pictures for us to meet again,
Sautee,&#8221; said Rathburn easily. &#8220;Our business wasn&#8217;t
finished. We ain&#8217;t through yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any more money,&#8221; Sautee gasped
out. &#8220;There&#8217;s no money up here at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there is,&#8221; said Rathburn with a mirthless
smile. &#8220;There&#8217;s twenty-odd thousand dollars
in my right-hand coat pocket. Now I wonder what
you&#8217;ve got in yours. It don&#8217;t stand to reason you&#8217;d
start out this time without a gun. Stand up!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>Sautee rose. His face was ashen. He held his
hands high as Rathburn pressed his weapon against
his chest and relieved him of the automatic which
he carried. Rathburn felt his other pockets and then
smiled agreeably. He tossed the automatic on the
desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll get goin&#8217;,&#8221; he announced, indicating
the open door. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hurry, for
I take it you&#8217;ve sent for somebody from the mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked Sautee without
moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; for a little mornin&#8217; walk, if you
act reasonable,&#8221; replied Rathburn. &#8220;That was my
intention. But if you don&#8217;t want to go&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged, and as Sautee looked fixedly at
him, he cocked his gun.</p>
<p>Sautee hurried toward the door with Rathburn
following him closely. When they were outside
Rathburn directed Sautee across the street. When
they reached Rathburn&#8217;s horse Rathburn quickly
mounted and motioned to the mines manager to
precede him into the timber behind the little village.
When they gained the shelter of the timber they
gradually circled around until they struck a trail
which led up above the mine. They started up
this, Sautee leading the way on foot with Rathburn
following on his horse and keeping his gun
trained on the mines manager&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; Rathburn crooned. &#8220;I won&#8217;t shoot
you in the back, Sautee. That wouldn&#8217;t be accordin&#8217;
to my ethics. But I&#8217;d have to stop you if
you made a break to leave the present company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee plodded on, his breath coming in gasps,
the perspiration standing out on his forehead.</p>
<p>The trail joined with another well-worn path a
short distance above the mine. The eastern sky
now was light, and Rathburn saw a stone building
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
above them. He also saw that they were on the
steep slope of the big mountain on which the Dixie
Queen was located, and that there was a rift in
this mountain to the left which indicated the presence
of a pass there.</p>
<p>In a few minutes they reached the stone building.
It had an iron door across which was painted the
legend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DANGER
POWDER&ndash;&ndash;DYNAMITE
KEEP AWAY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rathburn dismounted and tossed the reins over
his horse&#8217;s head so the animal would stand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That place looks like a natural jail,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the mine&#8217;s powder house,&#8221; said Sautee, wiping
his wet forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Rathburn rejoined, &#8220;that&#8217;s just what it
is. I expect there&#8217;s enough powder in there to blow
half this mountain off.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked to the door and took out his gun as
he examined the padlock.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; asked Sautee excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to blow the lock off,&#8221; said Rathburn
coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it!&#8221; cried Sautee. &#8220;There&#8217;s high-percentage
dynamite in there and T N T caps that we
use on road work&ndash;&ndash;dozens of boxes of it. You
might set it off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn looked at the quaking mine manager
speculatively. &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said finally, turning
aside to grin to himself. &#8220;I guess any little jar
might start it workin&#8217;. It goes off easy, I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are caps and detonators in there, too,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
said Sautee quickly. &#8220;You might shoot into them
some way, you never can tell. Well, it would be as
bad for you as for me.&#8221; He uttered the last sentence
in a note of triumph.</p>
<p>Rathburn was looking at the far-flung view below.
He turned a hard gaze on Sautee. &#8220;What difference
do you suppose it would make to me if that stuff in
there goes off?&#8221; he demanded in a harsh voice.
&#8220;Look down there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee looked and drew in his breath with a gasp.</p>
<p>In the clear light of the blossoming dawn the
whole panorama of the lower mountain country was
spread out before them. To the left, under the
towering peaks of the divide, the rounded crest of
the hogback was discernible, and a black spot marked
the location of Mannix&#8217;s automobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a car over there,&#8221; said Rathburn, noting
the direction of Sautee&#8217;s gaze.</p>
<p>Almost directly below them a number of mounted
men filed over a ridge and again disappeared in the
timber. Off to the right more horsemen were to
be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like there was a posse or two out this
morning,&#8221; said Rathburn in a forbidding voice. &#8220;I
reckon I ain&#8217;t such a fool as not to know who
they&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for, Sautee. Now maybe you can
figure out why I ain&#8217;t as scared of that powder
house as you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can stop them!&#8221; cried Sautee in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Rathburn agreed. &#8220;You can say you lied
about me takin&#8217; the money&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em you gave it back!&#8221; said Sautee
hoarsely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em you brought it on up to the
mine and that it&#8217;s in the safe. I&#8217;ll square it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t square the rewards that are out for
The Coyote,&#8221; said Rathburn sternly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
stepped into a bigger game than you thought, Sautee,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s got plumb out of your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on the mine manager fiercely. &#8220;Whatever
happens, remember this: Once a man gets a
bad reputation in a country like this or the country
I come from, he&#8217;s got it for keeps. He can&#8217;t get
away from it no matter how he acts or what he
does. Mine has drove me away from the place
where I belong; it&#8217;s followed me here; I can&#8217;t lose
it; an&#8217; the way things has been going, by glory, I
don&#8217;t know if I <i>want</i> to lose it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee cowered back under the fierceness in Rathburn&#8217;s
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you can tell &#8217;em, if you ever have a chance
to talk again, that I earned my reputation square!
I ain&#8217;t involved nobody else, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t stole from
any poor people, an&#8217; I never threw my gun down on
a man who didn&#8217;t start for his first.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deadly earnestness and the note of regret in
Rathburn&#8217;s tone caused Sautee to forget his uneasiness
temporarily and stare at the man in wonder.
Rathburn&#8217;s eyes were narrowed, his gaze was steel
blue, and his face was drawn into hard, grim lines
as he looked out upon the far-flung, glorious vista
below them, broken here and there by the movement
of mounted men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Sautee faltered in his speech.
His words seemed impotent in the face of Rathburn&#8217;s
deadly seriousness.</p>
<p>Rathburn turned abruptly to the powder house
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; cried Sautee.</p>
<p>The mines manager dug frantically into his pockets
and drew out a bunch of keys.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some locks on this property to which
there are only two keys,&#8221; he explained nervously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
&#8220;This is one of them, and I carry the second key.
Here!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out the key ring with one key extended.</p>
<p>Rathburn thrust his gun back into its holster and
took the keys. In a moment he had unlocked the
padlock and swung open the iron door, exposing case
after case of high explosive within the stone structure.</p>
<p>Sautee was staring at him in dire apprehension.</p>
<p>Rathburn pointed toward the rift in the mountain
on the left above them. Sautee looked and saw a
man and a boy riding down the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks to me like the man that held me up
last night,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;He looks like one of
the men, anyway. Maybe he&#8217;s found out he didn&#8217;t
get much, eh? Maybe he&#8217;s coming back because he
didn&#8217;t have enough to make a get-away with. Maybe
he thinks he was double crossed or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s features were working in a spasm of
fear and worry. Suddenly he turned on Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get away?&#8221; he asked in eager
pleading. &#8220;That trail will take you out of the mountains
and down into the desert country. You&#8217;re from
the desert, aren&#8217;t you? You can make it. You&#8217;ve
made a good haul. Go! It&#8217;ll be better for me and
all of us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed bitterly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go because I&#8217;m
a worse fool than you are,&#8221; he said acridly. &#8220;Get
in there. Sneaking lizards, man, can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m
tempted to put a shot into one of them boxes and
blow us both to kingdom come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee shrank back into the powder house, and
Rathburn slammed the door.</p>
<p>As Rathburn snapped the padlock and thrust the
keys into his pocket his eyes again sought the trail to
the left above him. No one was in sight. The man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
and the boy had disappeared in a bend or depression
in the trail.</p>
<p>But when he looked down toward the hogback he
saw a car coming up the road toward the mine. A
number of horsemen had taken its place on the hogback.</p>
<p>Rathburn ran for his horse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A SECOND CAPTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn rode straight up the trail which led
from the powder house toward the pass over the
big mountain. His eyes were gleaming with satisfaction,
but several times they clouded with doubt,
and he felt the bank notes in his coat pocket. Each
time, however, he would shake his head and push
on up the trail with renewed energy.</p>
<p>Looking backward and downward, he could see
the posses gathering in the street of the mine village.
He sensed the excitement which had followed the
sudden disappearance of Sautee and smiled grimly.
He saw that the automobile from the hogback had
reached the village. Scores of men were clustered
about it. He knew Mannix was taking personal
charge of the man hunt; but there was a chance to
get away!</p>
<p>He looked wistfully eastward. Somewhere off
there, beyond the rolling foothills, was the desert.
He thrilled. It had been there he had made his first
mistake. Goaded by the loss of his small cattle
ranch he had taken revenge on the man who had
foreclosed on him and others in a similar predicament.
He had held up the bank and restored a small
measure of the losses. Even then the profit of the
unscrupulous money lender had been enormous.</p>
<p>But the law had marked Rathburn. The gunmen
who were jealous of his reputation as an expert at
the draw had forced him to fall back upon that draw
to protect his life. Thus he had been driven to obtain
a living in the best way he could, and something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
in the dangerous, uncertain life of the outlaw had
appealed to his wild blood.</p>
<p>Sautee had said the money in his pocket was a
good haul. Why not? He looked again to eastward.
Over the big mountain&ndash;&ndash;into the timber&ndash;&ndash;a
circling back&ndash;&ndash;a straight cut east&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He knew he could do it. He had evaded posses
before&ndash;&ndash;posses composed of trained men who were
accustomed to take the man trail. It would actually
be rare sport to play with the crowd below. His left
hand dropped idly into his coat pocket, and he started
as he fingered what was there. Then his brow became
furrowed, and he scowled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I ain&#8217;t such a good guesser after all,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m just what I told Sautee&ndash;&ndash;a
fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught sight of a man and a boy above him.
Another instant and they were lost to view.</p>
<p>Rathburn suddenly put the spurs to his horse, and
the dun surged up the steep trail. As he rode, Rathburn
took his rawhide lariat from its place on the
saddle. At a point above where the trail twisted
about a huge outcropping of rock he turned off, dismounted,
and crept to the top of the rocks. Quickly
he surveyed the trail above. Then he slipped back
down to his horse, got in the saddle, and took up a
position just at the lower end of the outcropping,
some little distance back from the trail and above it.
He held the lariat ready in his hands.</p>
<p>He sat his horse quietly&ndash;&ndash;listening. The wind had
died with the dawn, and there was no sound in the
hills. The sun was mounting in the sky to eastward.
Rathburn looked out over the timbered slopes below
with wistful eyes. Suddenly his gaze became alert.
The sound of horses upon the rocky trail above the
outcropping came to his ears.</p>
<p>Gradually the sound became more and more distinct.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
He could hear the hoofs of the horses striking
against the rock of the trail. He shook out the
noose of his rope, and it sang as it whirled in the air.</p>
<p>The head of a horse had hardly pushed past the
rock when Rathburn&#8217;s noose went swirling downward
and dropped true over its target. The man in
the saddle loosed a string of curses as he felt the
rawhide lariat tighten about his arms and chest. His
horse shied, and he was dragged from the saddle,
landing on his feet, but falling instantly.</p>
<p>The second horse reared back, and Rathburn&#8217;s gun
covered the boy in the saddle. Rathburn, keeping
tight hold on the rope hand over hand, and retaining
his gun in his right hand at the same time, ran down
the short pitch. The boy&#8217;s horse became still, and
while the youth stared Rathburn trussed up the first
rider and then stood off to look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just takin&#8217; a mornin&#8217; ride, Carlisle?&#8221; he asked
cheerfully. &#8220;Or did you forget something? Don&#8217;t
make any false moves, kid. I ain&#8217;t in a playful
mood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy continued to stare, but Carlisle&#8217;s face was
black with rage, and curses flowed from his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t get you anything,&#8221; Rathburn said
coolly. &#8220;You might better be doin&#8217; some tall thinking
instead of cussing. You ain&#8217;t got the cards
stacked for this deal, Carlisle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your game?&#8221; Carlisle managed to get out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a deep one,&#8221; Rathburn replied dryly. &#8220;An&#8217;
it&#8217;s too complicated to tell you now. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
give you a chance to do the thinking I mentioned a
while back. I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; your gun or your horse.
The only thing I&#8217;m takin&#8217; is a chance, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t
takin&#8217; it on <i>your</i> account.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant Rathburn&#8217;s eyes burned with fury.
Then he dragged Carlisle into the shelter of the rocks,
to the side of the trail, and tied his horse near by.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Mounting, he motioned to the boy to ride down the
trail ahead of him. He looked at the big hat and the
overalls the boy wore. The youth looked wildly
about and then drove the spurs into his mount and
dashed down the trail with Rathburn close behind,
calling to him to take it easy.</p>
<p>Just as they reached a spot directly above the powder
house the boy reined in his horse. Rathburn saw
he was looking down at the turbulent scene in the
street of the little village below the mine. Then the
boy swayed in the saddle, and Rathburn had just
time to fling himself to the ground and catch the
senseless form in his arms as it toppled.</p>
<p>He put his burden down on the grass beside the
trail and led his horse into the timber and tied him.
Next he picked up the boy and made his way down
to the powder house. The shouts of many men came
to him from far below. He succeeded in getting out
the keys and unlocking the padlock which secured the
door of the powder house. Then he opened the door,
covered the frightened mine manager with his gun,
and carried his burden in with one arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the accomplices,&#8221; he said briefly to Sautee,
as he put the lad down and loosened the shirt at the
throat. &#8220;He&#8217;ll come around in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s eyes were popping from his head. He
leaned back upon the cases of dynamite and passed a
clammy hand over his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got Carlisle, too,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;Takin&#8217;
it all around from under it ain&#8217;t a bad morning&#8217;s
haul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee now stared at him with a new look in his
eyes&ndash;&ndash;a look in which doubt struggled with terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you <i>are</i> The Coyote!&#8221; he blurted
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you reckon I might be, if I ain&#8217;t?&#8221; Rathburn
asked quietly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You might be some kind of a deputy or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed harshly. &#8220;It just happens I&#8217;m
the man some folks call The Coyote,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like the name, but it was wished on me, an&#8217; I
can&#8217;t seem to shake it off. If I wasn&#8217;t the man you
think I am you wouldn&#8217;t be in such a tight fix,
Sautee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s words conveyed a subtle menace which
was not lost on the mine manager. Sautee cringed
and rubbed his hands in his nervous tension.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; exclaimed Rathburn.</p>
<p>From below came the echoes of shouts and other
sounds which conveyed the intelligence that a large
body of men was on the move up to the mine and
the mountain slope above.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after me,&#8221; said Rathburn bitterly. &#8220;They
think I stole the pay-rolls. They can&#8217;t get me, Sautee&ndash;&ndash;not
alive. An&#8217; if they get me the other way I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to see to it somehow that I don&#8217;t get blamed
for these jobs up here. Now, do you begin to see
daylight?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee wet his dry lips. The figure on the floor
stirred. The shouts from below sounded more distinct.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s gun leaped into his hand. &#8220;You better
start hoping the shootin&#8217; don&#8217;t begin till we understand
each other, Sautee,&#8221; he said grimly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
come to the show-down!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>QUICK FACTS</h3>
</div>
<p>Disregarding the sounds which continued to
come from below, Rathburn stood, gun in hand,
regarding Sautee with a grim countenance and a cold
look in his keen, gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw that truck driver held up, Sautee. I was
on a ridge below the divide. I saw the tall man in
the black slicker, his pardner, an&#8217; the boy. I didn&#8217;t
figure it would do any good to tell Mannix I&#8217;d taken
in the show, an&#8217; I was on my way to the desert. I&#8217;d
be there now if Carlisle hadn&#8217;t overstepped the mark
in that Red Feather place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee pricked up his ears. &#8220;You let them arrest
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I knew Mannix didn&#8217;t know who I was
an&#8217; didn&#8217;t have anything on me,&#8221; said Rathburn
quickly. &#8220;An&#8217; I got peevish at Carlisle an&#8217; plumb
suspicious when he tried to make things look bad for
me right there at the start. I began to wise up to
the whole lay when you got me out of jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s face went white again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fine explanations of why you couldn&#8217;t get
that money up to the mine were thin as water,
Sautee. You could get that money up there if you
wanted to, an&#8217; when you asked me to carry the package
to the mine it was a dead out-an&#8217;-out give-away.
I reckon you didn&#8217;t play me to have any sense, an&#8217; I
don&#8217;t think you gave Carlisle credit for havin&#8217; the
brains of a jack rabbit, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed as the mine manager stared at
mention of Carlisle&#8217;s name again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said contemptuously. &#8220;I know it
was Carlisle who held me up. I take it he figured that
you&#8217;d actually put money in that package. Wouldn&#8217;t
be surprised if it was him that you got to try that
stunt. An&#8217; he started away with the package as soon
as he got it instead of sneakin&#8217; back home to split
with you. He double crossed you an&#8217; you double
crossed him an&#8217; me. Now I&#8217;m double crossing the
two of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s look had changed to one of anger. He
glared at Rathburn, forgetting his predicament.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have a fine time proving any of this nonsense,&#8221;
he found the courage to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not only goin&#8217; to prove what I&#8217;ve said so far,
but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to prove that these robberies were a
put-up job between you an&#8217; Carlisle, with somebody
helping you,&#8221; said Rathburn. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in the mining
game myself, Sautee, but in our country men
spend their lives hunting metal to make some bunch
of stockholders rich. Maybe they get something out
of it themselves, an&#8217; maybe they don&#8217;t; but they&#8217;re
square, an&#8217; the men that run the mines are square
&#8217;most always. Anyway they develop properties, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s more&#8217;n you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;re not doing this
camp any good. You&#8217;re bleeding the mine an&#8217; the
company, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose you&ndash;&ndash;The Coyote&ndash;&ndash;are taking a
hand in this business as a matter of principle,&#8221; sneeringly
replied Sautee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t take a hand,&#8221; Rathburn pointed out
sternly. &#8220;You an&#8217; Carlisle forced a hand on me, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to play it out. I&#8217;ve another reason, too,&#8221;
he added mysteriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you say you had Carlisle?&#8221; Sautee asked in
feigned anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him dead to rights,&#8221; replied Rathburn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
shortly, taking some paper and a pencil from a
pocket.</p>
<p>Sautee looked at him curiously as he started to
write on the paper. &#8220;Going to write it all out and
leave it?&#8221; he asked sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put it outside the powder house in a
place where Mannix or some of the others will be
sure to find it,&#8221; was the puzzling answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they&#8217;ll believe it quicker if it&#8217;s in writing,&#8221;
said Sautee bravely.</p>
<p>Rathburn finished writing, folded the paper, and
placed it in the left-hand pocket of his coat. He
carefully put away the pencil. His next act caused
Sautee real concern.</p>
<p>Using a drill which was there for the purpose, evidently,
Rathburn broke open a box of dynamite caps
and a box of dynamite. A single coil of fuse was
lying on a box. He quickly affixed the cap to a
stick of the dynamite and crimped on a two-foot
length of fuse. Then he moved the opened box of
dynamite to the doorway and struck the stick with
cap and fuse attached into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, evidently greatly satisfied with
his work. &#8220;That fuse will burn about two minutes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He paused. &#8220;That&#8217;s too long,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>Perspiration again stood out on Sautee&#8217;s forehead
as he watched Rathburn cut off a foot of the fuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; said Rathburn with a queer smile.
&#8220;That&#8217;ll burn about a minute. Time enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee stared in horrified fascination at the foot
of fuse which stuck straight out from the box of
dynamite in the doorway. &#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what are you
going to do?&#8221; he gasped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Sautee,&#8221; said Rathburn coolly. &#8220;When
that stick of powder explodes it&#8217;ll set off the box an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
the other boxes, an&#8217; instead of a powder house here
there&#8217;ll be a big hole in the side of the mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man&ndash;&ndash;man&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re not going to do&ndash;&ndash;<i>that</i>!&#8221;
Sautee&#8217;s words came in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to have to do,&#8221;
said Rathburn as he bent over the form on the floor
of the powder house.</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes were open and were staring into
Rathburn&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Rathburn lifted him to his feet, where he stood
unsteadily. Again the gun was in Rathburn&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;This party is goin&#8217; to leave us,&#8221; he said to the
frightened mine manager. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to step just
outside for a minute. It&#8217;s your chance to make a
break, Sautee; but if you try it I&#8217;ll send a bullet into
that cap. Maybe you heard somewhere that I can
shoot tolerably well,&#8221; he concluded in his drawl.</p>
<p>Sautee gripped the sides of the boxes piled behind
him.</p>
<p>Rathburn led the boy outside and said quickly:
&#8220;Just what is this man Carlisle to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of fear, remorse, dejection&ndash;&ndash;all commingled
and pleading&ndash;&ndash;came into the dark eyes that
looked up into his.</p>
<p>Rathburn didn&#8217;t wait for a verbal answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your horse is just up the trail a piece,&#8221; he said
hurriedly. &#8220;Get up there&ndash;&ndash;go up behind the powder
house, so the men below can&#8217;t see you. Swing off
into the timber to the left and get down out of here.
I&#8217;ll keep their attention. Go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited a moment until he saw that his instructions
were being carried out, then he leaped again to
the doorway of the powder house.</p>
<p>Sautee&#8217;s face was livid, and his teeth were chattering.
Rathburn took a match from his shirt pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; screamed Sautee. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk. You were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
right. It was a frame-up. I&#8217;ll tell everything&ndash;&ndash;<i>everything</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>The perspiration was streaming from his face, and
his voice shook with terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a chance to talk in less than a minute,&#8221;
said Rathburn calmly.</p>
<p>A chorus of shouts came from the trail just below
the powder house as a number of men came into
view.</p>
<p>Rathburn stepped in front of the door with the
match in his left hand and his gun in his right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE SHOW-DOWN</h3>
</div>
<p>A wild chorus of yells greeted him. He had
surmised that the men had seen him coming
back down the trail to the powder house with his human
burden. Now he called Sautee into view. They
would most naturally assume that it was the mine
manager he had been carrying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the door where they can see you,&#8221; he
called to Sautee.</p>
<p>The ring in his voice brought Sautee, white-faced
and shivering, to the doorway beside Rathburn.</p>
<p>Another round of yells followed the mine manager&#8217;s
appearance. Then there was a sudden stillness.
Rathburn saw that the crowd was made up
mostly of miners. They paused in the wide place
in the trail just below the powder house, and Mannix
pushed to the fore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you, Coyote,&#8221; he called sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you think I know it?&#8221; replied Rathburn
in a voice which carried to all the members of
the mob. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want me for robbing this
mine, Mannix; you want me for something you
don&#8217;t know anything about&ndash;&ndash;because I&#8217;ve got a record.
Wait a minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot out the words as the mob pushed a step
forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fellows take a couple more steps in this
direction I&#8217;ll put a bullet into this box of dynamite!&#8221;</p>
<p>The movement stopped instantly. Men stared up
at him breathlessly, for they realized that he meant
what he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>Mannix&#8217;s face was pale, but his eyes glowed with
determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s worth it, Coyote?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step up here, Mannix, an&#8217; listen to what this
fellow has to say,&#8221; was Rathburn&#8217;s reply. &#8220;Men,&#8221;
he called in a loud voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; to you to give
your mine boss an&#8217; your deputy sheriff a fair deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur among the men. Mannix,
after a moment of hesitation, stepped forward.</p>
<p>Rathburn swung on Sautee. &#8220;Tell him!&#8221; he commanded
in a voice which stung like the crack of a
whip on still air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I had a hand in the business,&#8221; said Sautee
frantically. &#8220;It was Carlisle and me. We&ndash;&ndash;we
framed the robberies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mannix&#8217;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him where I got that money last night,&#8221;
Rathburn thundered. &#8220;Tell him, Sautee, or, so help
me, I&#8217;ll drill a hole through you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sautee cowered before the deadly ferocity in Rathburn&#8217;s
voice. &#8220;I had it in the&ndash;&ndash;office&ndash;&ndash;downtown,&#8221;
he stammered. &#8220;There was blank paper in that package,
Mannix. Let him go&ndash;&ndash;let him go, Mannix, or
we&#8217;ll all be killed!&#8221; Sautee cried.</p>
<p>Rathburn was looking steadily at the deputy.
&#8220;Carlisle is roped an&#8217; tied up the trail by the big
rocks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Send up there for him an&#8217; bring
him down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several of the men who were mounted spurred
their horses up the steep trail. There was utter silence
now among the men. Mannix, too, was cool
and collected. He had not drawn his gun. He surveyed
the quaking Sautee with a look of extreme
contempt. The mine manager&#8217;s nerves had gone to
pieces before Rathburn&#8217;s menacing personality. All
he cared for now was his life. The black reputation
he had given to Rathburn led him to believe that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
man could not be depended upon, and that he was
liable to carry out his threat and blow them all to
bits. He wet his lips with a feverish tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the money you an&#8217; Carlisle got away
with?&#8221; demanded Mannix.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all I took,&#8221; whined Sautee. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it
back. I don&#8217;t know what Carlisle&#8217;s done with his.
It was his scheme, anyway; he proposed it when he
hit this country a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; suggested Mannix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike Reynolds,&#8221; cried Sautee. &#8220;But he was only
in on the truck driver deal and&ndash;&ndash;last night. Let The
Coyote go, Mannix&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Sautee, in a frenzy of fear, an easy prey to
the seriousness of the situation and his shattered
nerves, told everything. He explained how it had
been Carlisle who proposed getting Rathburn out of
jail and making him the goat. He told of the worthless
contents of the package he had given Rathburn
to carry to the mine, how they had planned to rob
him on the way and thus put him in a situation where
he would have to get out of the country. He explained
how Carlisle had pointed out that they had a
club over Rathburn&#8217;s head in their knowledge of his
real identity. He complained that Carlisle had intended
to double cross him, and how he had double
crossed Carlisle in turn. He ended with a whining
plea for consideration at the hands of Mannix.</p>
<p>The men with Carlisle came down the trail. Carlisle
was astride his own horse. His gun was in his
holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got you, you outlaw!&#8221; he cried as he
flung himself from the saddle and strode up to Rathburn,
Mannix, and Sautee.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes had narrowed until they were slits
through which his cold, hard gaze centered upon
Carlisle. His attitude had changed. Even his posture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
was suddenly different. There was a long
breath from the men behind Mannix. It was a tense
moment. They could see the menace in Rathburn&#8217;s
manner, and they could see that Carlisle was fighting
mad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you a little free with your language, Carlisle?&#8221;
drawled Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know who he is?&#8221; Carlisle cried to Mannix.
&#8220;He&#8217;s The Coyote&ndash;&ndash;an outlaw an&#8217; a killer with a
price a mile long on his head&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t never sneaked any miners&#8217; pay-rolls,
Carlisle,&#8221; Rathburn broke in with a sneering inflection
in his voice. &#8220;What&#8217;d you do with Mike Reynolds?
He was with you last night, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlisle&#8217;s jaw snapped shut. He swung on Rathburn
with eyes darting red. Then his gaze flashed
to the cringing Sautee.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you rat&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn stepped before Sautee. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
any quarrel with him, Carlisle,&#8221; he said evenly; &#8220;your
quarrel, if you&#8217;ve got one, is with me. I outguessed
you, that&#8217;s all. You ain&#8217;t plumb clever, Carlisle.
You ought to be in a more genteel business. I just
naturally figured out the play an&#8217; made Sautee talk,
that&#8217;s all. I ain&#8217;t the only gent Mannix is wanting&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
<i>three</i> of us here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carlisle&#8217;s face was purple and working in spasms
of rage. He realized instantly that Rathburn had
spoken the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was his scheme from the start!&#8221; shrilled Sautee
from the protection of Rathburn&#8217;s broad shoulders.</p>
<p>Then the mine manager, unable to longer stand the
strain, collapsed on the ground, groaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Underhanded!&#8221; Carlisle shot through his teeth
as Mannix stepped back. &#8220;An&#8217; I heard The Coyote
was a go-getter. By guns, I believe you&#8217;re yellow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a chance to try an&#8217; finish what you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
started in the Red Feather the day I got here, Carlisle,&#8221;
said Rathburn in ringing tones. &#8220;If you think
I&#8217;m yellow&ndash;&ndash;draw!&#8221;</p>
<p>A second&#8217;s hesitation&ndash;&ndash;two figures in identical
postures under the morning sun&ndash;&ndash;a vagrant breeze
murmuring in the timber.</p>
<p>Then two movements, quick as lightning&ndash;&ndash;too fast
for the eye to follow&ndash;&ndash;and the roar of guns.</p>
<p>Rathburn stepped back, his weapon smoking at his
hip, as Carlisle swayed for a moment and then
crumpled upon the ground. Rathburn quickly drew
the piece of paper from his left pocket and the roll
of bills from his right. He put the note with the
bills and tossed the roll to Mannix. Then he stepped
back to the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Join your men, Mannix,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Mannix thrust the money into a pocket and stood
for several seconds looking directly into Rathburn&#8217;s
eyes. A curious expression was on the deputy&#8217;s
face, partly wonder, partly admiration, partly doubt.
Then he turned abruptly upon his heel and walked
back to the gaping men.</p>
<p>Sautee struggled to his feet. Rathburn motioned
to him to join the others, and he staggered down to
them.</p>
<p>Then Rathburn coolly lit a match and touched it
to the fuse sticking out from the box of dynamite.</p>
<p>There was a wild yell of terror, and the mob
tumbled down the trail as Rathburn ran for the trail
above the powder house. The men had disappeared
when he turned. His gun leaped into his hand and
he fired&ndash;&ndash;once, twice, three times&ndash;&ndash;the fourth shot
cut the burning fuse, and with a sharp intaking of
breath, he ran for his horse, mounted, and rode into
the timber along the trail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>FILED!</h3>
</div>
<p>Rathburn picked his way slowly through the
timber around to the southeast and then directly
down toward the town. It was slow going, and the
man seemed to relish this fact. His face was
thoughtful, wistful, a bit grave. He occasionally
patted his horse&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on our way home, old hoss,&#8221; he said softly.
&#8220;Seems like we just <i>had</i> to stop off here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fingered two small objects in his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I wonder if I could
be mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned west after a time and rode carefully
until he gained a worn trail. This he followed down
toward town, and in half an hour he dismounted in
the timber behind a small cabin at the side of the
road to the hogback.</p>
<p>Rathburn went to the rear door and knocked. He
received no answer, but sounds came to him through
an open window. He opened the door softly and
stole inside. There was no one in the kitchen. The
sounds came from another room. He passed on into
a bedroom and turned into another bedroom where
he saw a figure in overalls lying on the bed. A great
mass of dark hair covered the pillow. The form
shook with sobs.</p>
<p>Rathburn laid a gentle hand upon the shoulder,
and the face, which was quickly turned to him, was
the face of a girl&ndash;&ndash;the girl he had first seen when
coming into the town, the girl who had been sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the horse listening to Carlisle&#8217;s tirade, the girl the
barn man had said was supposed to be Carlisle&#8217;s
sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know you were up there,&#8221; said Rathburn
softly. &#8220;Your boy&#8217;s clothes fooled them, if
they saw you at all. They probably thought I was
carrying Sautee down the trail, for they found
Sautee up there in the powder house with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sobbed again. Her eyes were red with
weeping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Rathburn gently. &#8220;I picked
these up from the road the day the truck driver was
held up.&#8221; He brought out two hairpins from his
coat pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;It set me to thinking, ma&#8217;am, an&#8217; was one reason
why I stayed over here to find out what was goin&#8217;
on. Maybe I&#8217;ve done wrong, ma&#8217;am, but I was
hoping I&#8217;d be doin&#8217; you a favor. I saw the look in
your eyes the day Carlisle was talkin&#8217; to you when
you was on the hoss. I know you helped him in his
holdups, dressed like a boy, but I figured you didn&#8217;t
do it because you wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;no!&#8221; sobbed the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; fine, little girl. No one knows anything
about it but me, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; away. But,
listen, girlie, just what was Carlisle to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>A spasm of weeping shook the girl. &#8220;Nothing I
could help,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;He&ndash;&ndash;I had to do as he
said&ndash;&ndash;because&ndash;&ndash;oh, I hate him. I hate him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; soothed Rathburn. &#8220;I suspected as
much, girlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He made my father a bad man,&#8221; sobbed the
girl; &#8220;an&#8217; made me go with him or my father would
have to go&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;to go&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, girlie,&#8221; Rathburn interrupted softly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear the story. Just keep it to yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
an&#8217; start all over. It ain&#8217;t a bad world, girlie,
an&#8217; there&#8217;s more good men in it than there&#8217;s bad.
Now, you can begin to live and be happy like you
ought. Carlisle won&#8217;t worry you no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her head and looked at him out of
startled eyes in which there was a ray of hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say&ndash;&ndash;he won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;worry me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, girlie. He walked into his own trap.
I&#8217;m goin&#8217;, girlie. So long, an&#8217; good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her hand and pressed it, and under the
spell of his smile the hope came into her welling
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he called from the doorway.</p>
<p>She was smiling faintly through her tears when he
slipped out.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Deputy Sheriff Mannix was sitting in his little
office alone. It was nearly sunset. A faint glow of
crimson shot across the carpet.</p>
<p>Mannix was scowling thoughtfully. On the desk
before him were two pieces of paper. One of them
was a reward notice publishing the fact that The
Coyote was wanted and that five thousand dollars
would be paid by the State of Arizona for his capture,
dead or alive.</p>
<p>Mannix picked up the second piece of paper and
again read the words penciled upon it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am taking out of this money belonging to
the Dixie Queen the five hundred dollars Sautee
promised me for carrying the money to the mine,
and the two thousand dollars reward offered for
the capture of those who had been robbing the
Dixie Queen. I expect that shortly after this
gets into the proper hands Sautee will be in jail,
and he will be handy to tell you this is all O. K.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Rathburn</span>.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Mannix took up the reward notice, put it with the
note, and jammed the two pieces of paper into an
obscure pigeonhole in his desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Filed!&#8221; he said aloud.</p>
<p>Then he rose with a peculiar smile, went out upon
the little porch, and stared toward the east where
the reflection of the sunset cast a rosy glow over the
foothills leading down to the desert.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE PRODIGAL</h3>
</div>
<p>With face upraised to the breath of air which
stirred across the bare black lava hills, Rathburn
leaned forward in the saddle eagerly, while his
dun-colored horse stood patiently, seemingly in accord
with his master&#8217;s mood. A merciless sun beat
down from a hot, cloudless sky.</p>
<p>Below, stretching in endless miles was the desert&ndash;&ndash;a
sinister, forbidding land of desolate distances,
marked only by slender yucca palms, mesquite, dusty
greasewood, an occasional clump of green palo verde,
the slim fingers of the ocatilla, the high &#8220;forks&#8221; of
the giant sahuara, and clumps of la cholla cactus,
looking like apple orchards in full bloom.</p>
<p>Yet the man&#8217;s gaze fell for a moment lovingly on
each species of cactus and desert vegetation; his look
was that which dwells in the homesick eyes of a
traveler when he sees his native land from the deck
of an inbound ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoss, we&#8217;re home!&#8221; he said aloud, while the
animal pricked up its ears.</p>
<p>Then he looked off to the left, where the blue outlines
of a low range of mountains wavered in the
heat like a mirage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagination Range,&#8221; he said moodily.</p>
<p>He tickled the dun with his spurs and trotted
along the crest of the lava ridge. At its eastern
terminus he swung down into the desert and struck
straight east in the direction of Imagination Range.
The desert&#8217;s surface between the lava ridge and the
higher hills of the range to eastward was cut by dry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
washes and arroyos and miniature ridges studded
with giant cactus.</p>
<p>On the top of one of these high rises the horseman
suddenly reined in his mount and stared into the
south. &#8220;There&#8217;s trouble&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; spelled with a capital
T!&#8221; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>The gaze in his keen gray eyes centered upon a
number of riders speeding their horses over the tumbled
section of desert below him to his right. He
made out two divisions of horsemen. One group
was some distance ahead of the other. Even as he
stared down at them, its group separated, and some
rode for Imagination Range, while others hastened
toward the lava hills, or due north in his direction.
The second group halted for a brief spell, evidently
for a conference, and then its members also divided
and started in swift pursuit of the men ahead.</p>
<p>The watcher on the top of the rise frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of here, hoss,&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t
our day for visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pushed on eastward, increasing its pace, but
losing time in skirting the frequent bits of high
ground. As he rode down into a deep arroyo, a
horseman came galloping into its lower end and
raced almost upon him before seeing him. His hand
darted like lightning to his gun, and the weapon
snapped into aim at his hip. The horseman came to
a rearing halt, reins dangling, his hands held high,
his eyes bulging from their sockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rathburn!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; said the man with the gun. &#8220;What&#8217;s
all the disturbance down there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Long is chasing us,&#8221; the other answered with
a nervous grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I remember it,&#8221; drawled Rathburn, &#8220;Bob Long
is the sheriff of Mesquite County. You boys sure
ain&#8217;t been misbehaving?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worse than that,&#8221; said the fugitive, staring
doubtfully at his questioner. &#8220;The stage driver&#8217;s
dead. Had a notion the boss was foolin&#8217; when he
told him to reach up for the bugs in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who does the boss happen to be in this case?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time,&#8221; said Rathburn sarcastically;
&#8220;there&#8217;s nobody after you but the sheriff, an&#8217; he
probably won&#8217;t be along for a minute or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do <i>you</i> no good for him to find us here,&#8221;
said the other boldly.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes blazed. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re forgettin&#8217;
that Bob Long knows I travel alone,&#8221; he said
hotly. &#8220;He savvys I don&#8217;t travel with a crowd. I
ain&#8217;t found it necessary so far, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t aiming to
start. I counted eight in your gang&ndash;&ndash;to hold up one
stage, eh?&#8221; He concluded with a sneer, while the
other shifted nervously in his saddle and cast a quick
look back over his shoulder. There seemed no one
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be lookin&#8217; around,&#8221; Rathburn said
coldly. &#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to stay here till you answer
my question, if all the sheriffs in Arizona come
ridin&#8217; up meanwhile. Who&#8217;s headin&#8217; your gang?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t professional,&#8221; the fugitive grumbled.
&#8220;You&#8217;re just the same as one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, seeing the look that came into Rathburn&#8217;s
eyes, he said hastily: &#8220;Mike Eagen planned the lay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed it,&#8221; said Rathburn in a tone of contempt.
&#8220;Well, you better slope while you&#8217;ve still got
a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He motioned to the man to go, and the latter
rode at a gallop up the arroyo and out of sight.
Rathburn&#8217;s face wore a worried scowl, as he slid his
gun into its holster, whirled his horse, and speedily
climbed the east side of the arroyo.</p>
<p>From a vantage point he caught sight again of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the horsemen racing up from the south. They were
much nearer, and he could readily make out the
members of the sheriff&#8217;s posse. He had had experience
with posses before.</p>
<p>Striking around the crest of the high ground which
formed the east side of the arroyo, he again raced
toward the range of mountains in the east, taking advantage
of every bit of cover which offered concealment
from the riders approaching at top speed from
the south.</p>
<p>Occasional glances made it plain that the sheriff
was sending, or personally bringing, most of his
posse east in the direction of the mountains, presumably
in the hope of cutting off the outlaws from
seeking refuge in the hills. But the mountains were
Rathburn&#8217;s goal as well as the goal of a majority of
Mike Eagen&#8217;s band, though for totally different reasons.
He refused to change his direction, although
by going north, the stout, speedy dun could doubtless
outdistance the posse before the afternoon was spent.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s teeth snapped shut, his jaw squared,
and his eyes narrowed, as he saw indubitable signs
that he had been detected. Two of the posse were
waving their arms and dashing in his direction. At
that distance they could not identify him, but under
the circumstances such identification was unnecessary.
His presence there, riding like mad, was certain to
convince the pursuers that he was one of the gang
responsible for the stage job. This was obvious.</p>
<p>For good reasons, Rathburn did not want it generally
known that he was back in a country where
he had spent most of his life, and where he was
branded as a desperate outlaw with a big price on
his head. Consequently, seeing that the sheriff&#8217;s
men were out to get him, he abandoned all attempt at
concealment, drove in his spurs, gave the dun horse
its head, and raced for the mountains.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>Other members of the posse who were farther to
the east caught the signals of the two who were in
hot pursuit of Rathburn, and they dashed north to
cut him off. The outlaws had disappeared, and
Rathburn shook his head savagely, as he realized
they had sought cover when they saw the chase was
directed at one man. Without having had a hand in
the holdup of the stage, he had arrived on the spot
just in time to draw the fire of the authorities. And
fire it was now; for the men behind him had begun
shooting in the hope of a chance hit at the distance.</p>
<p>A scant mile separated him from his goal. He
came to a level stretch which was almost a mass of
green because of the clumps of palo verde. Here he
urged the dun to its utmost, outdistanced the pair
in his rear, and gained on the men riding from the
south, almost ahead of him. He swerved a bit to
the north and cut straight for a notch in the mountains.
He smiled, as he approached it, and saw a
narrow defile leading into the hills. He gained it in
a final, heartbreaking burst of speed on the part of
his mount. As he dashed into the ca&ntilde;on, bullets
sang past him and over his head. Then a cry of
amazement came to his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s The Coyote!&#8221; a man was yelling. &#8220;Rathburn&#8217;s
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>He dashed into the shelter of the defile, a grim
smile playing on his lips. He had been recognized.
His face hardened. He rounded a huge boulder,
checked his horse, and dismounted. He could hear
the pound of hoofs in the entrance of the narrow
ca&ntilde;on. A rider came into view below.</p>
<p>Rathburn leaned out from the protection of the
boulder. His lips were pressed into a fine, white line,
and there was a look of haunted worry in his eyes.
His gun flashed in his hand. The rider saw him
and yelled, spurring his horse. Then Rathburn&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
gun swung quickly upward. A sharp report sounded,
like a crash of thunder in the narrow confines of the
ca&ntilde;on, and its echoes reverberated through the hills.</p>
<p>The rider toppled in his saddle and fell to the
floor of the ca&ntilde;on. His horse came to a snorting
stop, reins dangling, all four legs braced. The hoof-beats
instantly were stilled. A silence, complete and
sinister, reigned in the defile.</p>
<p>Rathburn slipped his smoking gun into his holster
and mounted noiselessly. Then he walked his horse
slowly up the ca&ntilde;on, sitting sidewise in the saddle to
keep a vigil on the trail behind. A minute later he
heard a volley of shots below, the signal to all the
scattered members of the posse to race to the entrance
of the ca&ntilde;on. He increased his pace, broke
his gun, extracted the empty shell, and inserted a
fresh cartridge in its place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE DESERT CODE</h3>
</div>
<p>Keeping to the trail, Rathburn mounted higher
and higher and spoke continually to his horse in
a crooning tone of encouragement. His face was
drawn in grim lines, his eyes were constantly alert,
his very posture in the saddle showed that his nerves
were at high tension.</p>
<p>He ignored dim paths which occasionally led off
to the left or right in rifts in the sheer, black walls
of the narrow ca&ntilde;on. No sound came to him from
below. He knew the posse would have to proceed
with the utmost caution, for the sheriff and his men
could not be sure that they would not encounter him
at some bend in the trail. They would be expecting
shots from every boulder; for Rathburn had let
them know he had no intention of being taken easily
or alive.</p>
<p>The afternoon wore on, with Rathburn steadily
penetrating the very heart of Imagination Range.
Finally he swung out of the ca&ntilde;on trail and took a
dim path to the right. He dismounted and walked
back to rub off the scars left by his horse&#8217;s shoes on
the rock floor of the side trail. Satisfied that he
would leave the members of the posse confused as
to which side trail he had taken, he returned to his
horse, mounted, and proceeded up the narrow trail
leading to the top of the range to the south of the
deep ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>In the western sky the sun was low when he rode
down the crest of the range. The mountains were
devoid of vegetation, bleak and bare and black. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
lava rock seemed to absorb the heat of the sun and
throw it in the rider&#8217;s face. But Rathburn didn&#8217;t
appear to mind it.</p>
<p>He crossed the backbone of the range and began
the descent on the eastern side. But he descended
only a short distance before he swung out of the
saddle. From the slicker pack on the rear of his
saddle he took a pair of heavy leather gloves. He
cut these open in the palms with his pocketknife and
then tied them about the shoes on his horse&#8217;s hind
feet. The dun was only shod behind.</p>
<p>Again he mounted, and this time he turned to the
south and rode down a long slope of lava rock. He
grunted with satisfaction, as he looked behind and
saw that the leather prevented the shoes on his
mount&#8217;s hind feet from leaving their mark. He was
completely obliterating his trail&ndash;&ndash;leaving nothing for
the posse to follow, if they should trace him to the
top of the range.</p>
<p>He walked his horse slowly, for the dun did not
like the idea of the leather tied to its hoofs. In less
than two miles the leather was worn through upon
the hard rock, and he got down and removed the
remnants. He straightened up and looked out over
the vista of the desert.</p>
<p>The western sky was a sea of gold. Far to southward
a curl of smoke rose upward, marking the
course of a railroad and a town. Rathburn looked
long in this direction, with a dreamy, wistful light in
his eyes. Close at hand vegetation appeared upon
the slopes of the hills. His gaze darted here and
there along the ridges below him, and his parted lips
and eager attitude showed unmistakably that he was
familiar with every rod of the locality in which he
found himself.</p>
<p>Again he climbed into the saddle and turned off to
the left, entering a ca&ntilde;on. For better than half a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
mile he proceeded down this way, then he rode eastward
again, winding in and out in a network of
ca&ntilde;ons until he came to the rock-ribbed crest of a
ridge which overlooked an oasis in the desert hills.
There was green vegetation where the water from
a spring seeped into the floor of the ca&ntilde;on below
him. The spring was nothing more than a huge cup
in the rock which had caught the water from the
spring rains and filled. Above the spring was a
small cabin, and Rathburn saw that the cabin door
was open.</p>
<p>Hurriedly he rode down a trail to the right which
circled around into the ca&ntilde;on from its lower end.
As he galloped toward the spring, a figure appeared
in the doorway of the cabin. Rathburn waved an
arm and dismounted at the spring. He led his horse
to drink, as the man came walking toward him from
the cabin. He compelled the dun to drink slowly;
first a swallow, now two, then a few more; finally he
drew the horse away from the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have some more a little later,&#8221; he said
cheerfully. &#8220;Hello, Joe Price!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man walked up to him without a great show
of surprise and held out his hand. He was bareheaded,
and the hair which hung down to his shoulders
was snow-white. The face was seamed and
lined, burned by the sun of three score Arizona summers,
and the small, blue eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang me with a busted shoe string if it ain&#8217;t
Rathburn,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Why, boy, you&#8217;re
just in time for supper. Put your horse up behind
the cabin an&#8217; get in at the table. She&#8217;s a big country,
all full of cactus; but the old man&#8217;s got grub
left!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed, rinsed his mouth out with
water he dipped from the spring in a battered tin
cup, and took a swallow before he replied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Joe, there&#8217;s two things I want&ndash;&ndash;grub an&#8217; gaff.
I know you&#8217;ve got grub, or you wouldn&#8217;t be here;
but I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re any good at the gaff any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man scrutinized him. &#8220;You look some
older,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;Not much of the wild,
galootin&#8217; kid left in you, I &#8217;spect. But don&#8217;t go
gettin&#8217; fresh with me, or I&#8217;ll clout you one with my
prospectin&#8217; pick. Go &#8217;long now; put up your horse
an&#8217; hustle inside. If you want to wash up, I guess
you can&ndash;&ndash;bein&#8217; a visitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn chuckled, as he led his horse around behind
the cabin, where two burros were, and unsaddled
him. Before he entered the cabin he stood
for a moment looking up the ridge down which he
had come. The old man watched him, but made no
comment. As Rathburn sat down to the table, however,
he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kin hear anybody comin&#8217; down that trail over
the ridge, while they&#8217;re a mile away,&#8221; he said simply
without looking up.</p>
<p>Rathburn flashed a look of admiration at the old
man.</p>
<p>The glow of the sunset lit the hills with crimson
fire, and a light breeze stirred with the advent of the
long, colorful desert twilight. They ate in silence,
washing down the hardy food with long drafts of
strong coffee. The old man asked no questions of his
friend. He knew that in time Rathburn would talk.
A man&#8217;s business in that desolate land of dreadful
distances was his own, save such of it as he wanted
to tell. It was the desert code.</p>
<p>Supper over, they went out to a little bench in
front of the cabin. There Joe Price lit his pipe, and
Rathburn rolled a cigarette.</p>
<p>For some time they smoked in silence. The purple
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
twilight drifted over the hills, and the breeze freshened
in welcome relief to the heat of the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, I just had to come back,&#8221; said Rathburn
softly. &#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong with me. You wouldn&#8217;t
think I&#8217;d get homesick this way, after all the trouble
I&#8217;ve had here, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man removed his pipe. &#8220;Anybody here in
particular you want to see?&#8221; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>Rathburn shrugged. &#8220;You&#8217;re always gettin&#8217; right
down to cases first hand off an&#8217; running,&#8221; he complained.
&#8220;Of course there&#8217;s folks I want to see. I
want to see you, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon you&#8217;d be ridin&#8217; any terrible great
distance an&#8217; takin&#8217; chances by the handful just to see
me, boy,&#8221; said Price. &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t tryin&#8217; to pry into
your affairs. You don&#8217;t have to answer any of the
fool questions I ask you&ndash;&ndash;you know that. I&#8217;m an old
man an&#8217; gettin&#8217; childish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed. &#8220;I can believe that when I find
you still putterin&#8217; around up here where there ain&#8217;t
even a sign of mineral,&#8221; he chided.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s gold right under your feet,&#8221; said the old
man stoutly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have a payin&#8217; vein opened up here
in less&#8217;n three months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, Joe. There&#8217;s nobody I&#8217;d like more to
see make a big strike than you. You were my dad&#8217;s
friend, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve been mine. I haven&#8217;t got many
friends, Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But them you&#8217;ve got is good ones,&#8221; said Price
quickly. &#8220;How long you been away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About eight months,&#8221; Rathburn replied with a
frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to get away from the desert,&#8221; mused the
old man. &#8220;It&#8217;s in your blood. If you leave here for
good you&#8217;ve just naturally got to take something
along with you from here&ndash;&ndash;something that&#8217;s a part
of the desert, you might say.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>Rathburn looked keenly at the face of his friend.
But the old man was regarding his pipe, as if he had
never until that moment seen it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran into a posse chasin&#8217; a gang that robbed a
stage on the way over here this noon,&#8221; Rathburn
said presently.</p>
<p>Price&#8217;s interest quickened, but he made no sign.
&#8220;They saw you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; Rathburn grumbled. &#8220;Took
after me. I had to drop one of &#8217;em with a bullet in
the shoulder to slow &#8217;em up in the long ca&ntilde;on over
on the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know any of the gang?&#8221; Price asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Met one. Threw down my gun on him. He told
me Mike Eagen was runnin&#8217; the works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Price nodded. &#8220;I reckon Mike&#8217;s been pullin&#8217;
quite a few stunts while you been away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve been gettin&#8217; the blame for &#8217;em more&#8217;n
likely,&#8221; said Rathburn in indignation.</p>
<p>Price nodded again. &#8220;Might be so,&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked up at him in understanding.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll have me mixed up with this stage holdup,&#8221;
he said earnestly. &#8220;From what I gathered they
killed the driver, an&#8217; they&#8217;ll say that was my part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble, boy,&#8221; said the old miner. &#8220;If
a fellow&#8217;s handy with his gun somebody&#8217;s sure to get
jealous of him an&#8217; make him draw. If he gets his
man because he has to, he&#8217;s a killer. When he&#8217;s
known as a killer he ain&#8217;t got a chance. You <i>had</i> to
drop the two men you dropped aroun&#8217; here, boy; but
they ain&#8217;t forgettin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Long was headin&#8217; that posse,&#8221; said Rathburn
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Bob Long&#8217;s a sticker when he hits out on a
man&#8217;s trail,&#8221; said Price. &#8220;Still, I guess you&#8217;d be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
safe in here for a while. There ain&#8217;t many knows
this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t figure on stayin&#8217; here long, Joe,&#8221; said
Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you did,&#8221; said Price.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get goin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;hit for new country an&#8217;
never know when I may run up against the law in a
quarter where I ain&#8217;t expecting it; always sneaking
along&ndash;&ndash;like the coyote. It was Mike Eagen who
gave me that name, Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s voice was low and vibrant, and the old
man felt the menacing quality in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s more,&#8221; Rathburn went on, &#8220;I&#8217;m always
remembering that he&#8217;s back here, getting away with
his dirty tricks, shoving the blame off on me, some
way or other, when the chase gets too hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some time the old man was silent. When he
spoke he put an arm about Rathburn&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy, before you get worse mixed up than you are,
there&#8217;s a place you ought to visit aroun&#8217; here,&#8221; he
said in a fatherly tone.</p>
<p>Rathburn shrugged and stared up at the night sky
which was blossoming with stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a right smart risk,&#8221; Price went on,
&#8220;for they&#8217;d maybe think to drop aroun&#8217; that way on
a lookout for you; but I reckon before you do much
more, you better drop in at the Mallory place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn rose abruptly. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s what I
came up here to hear you say,&#8221; he said irritably.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t reckon it can be done, Joe. I haven&#8217;t
any business there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know, boy? Maybe you ain&#8217;t bein&#8217;
right fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me it would look better for me to stay
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to see you,&#8221; urged the old man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
&#8220;The Mallory place is a good fifteen miles from
Hope, close up against the mountains. Boy, don&#8217;t
you think you better make sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>The wistful, yearning look was back in Rathburn&#8217;s
eyes. His right hand rested upon the butt of his
gun. The other held his forgotten cigarette. He
turned and looked into the old man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, you said something about takin&#8217; something
from the desert if I left it. You&#8217;re right. But it
can&#8217;t be, Joe. This thing has killed my chances!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gun seemed to leap from its holster into his
hand at his hip of its own accord. The old miner&#8217;s
brows lifted in astonishment at the draw.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was you I wouldn&#8217;t be much scared who I
met on the way down to the Mallory place if I
didn&#8217;t meet too many of &#8217;em at once,&#8221; he said with
a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&#8217;t wear it&ndash;&ndash;there,&#8221; Rathburn faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, leave it hangin&#8217; on a handy peg, boy,&#8221; said
the old man cheerfully.</p>
<p>Rathburn jammed the gun back into its holster and
walked around to his horse. He led the animal
down to drink and then returned and saddled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You goin&#8217; on to-night?&#8221; asked Price casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m takin&#8217; a ride,&#8221; Rathburn confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; my advice at the same time, are
you?&#8221; asked Price, pretending to be greatly concerned.</p>
<p>Rathburn mounted and looked down upon him in
the faint light of the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Price, you&#8217;re a wise old desert rat, an&#8217; I&#8217;m a
young fool,&#8221; he said with a twinkle in his gray eyes.
&#8220;If Bob Long happens this way give him my regards
an&#8217; tell him they got the reward notices over
in California all right, for I saw &#8217;em stuck up over
there. So long.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>The old miner called out after him and watched
him ride down the ca&ntilde;on and disappear in the shadows.
Nor was he the only watcher; for, high on the
ridge above, another man touched his horse with his
spurs and started down the west side of the range,
as Rathburn vanished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT SUMMONS</h3>
</div>
<p>In two hours Rathburn came to a fence about a
small ranch. Cattle were grazing on the sparse
feed within the inclosure, and he saw a clump of
trees marking the site of a house.</p>
<p>He rode around the fence until he came to a gate.
There was a light shining from two of the windows
of the house. He passed through the gate, and, as
he approached the house from the side, he saw two
figures on the porch. He halted in the shelter of the
trees, and, as one of the figures crossed the beam of
light which shone out the door, he saw that it was a
man. He obtained a fleeting look at the man&#8217;s face.
He was comparatively young, not bad looking, with
blue eyes and a small, close-cropped, sandy mustache.</p>
<p>Rathburn scratched his head in an effort to place
the man. He seemed vaguely familiar. Rathburn
was sure he had seen him somewhere. But he gave
up the futile effort to identify him when he saw that
the other figure on the porch was that of a girl.</p>
<p>Dismounting, he led his horse around to the rear
and put him in a corral near the barn. He surmised
that it was about ten o&#8217;clock. As he walked toward
the front of the house, again he heard the sputtering
of a small motor car; then he saw the path of light
from its headlights go streaking across the desert in
the direction of the town to southward. The front
door closed, and all was still.</p>
<p>Rathburn hesitated for several moments, then he
stamped up the porch steps and knocked at the door.
It was opened by a girl. She held a lighted lamp in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
her hand. When she saw Rathburn standing, hat in
hand, before her, her dark eyes widened, and she
nearly dropped the lamp. He stepped forward quickly
and took it from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger!&#8221; she exclaimed breathlessly. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, Laura,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m home on
a&ndash;&ndash;a visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you were back,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;Mr.
Doane&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;a gentleman from town told me he
had heard you were back. But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She scanned his face closely and peered beyond
him into the shadows with visible concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, come in quickly,&#8221; she invited, stepping
back from the door.</p>
<p>With a faint smile he entered and closed the door
after him. He put the lamp down on the table in
what was evidently the sitting room of the small
house. He looked about him with the air of one who
sees familiar surroundings, but is embarrassed by
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one been tellin&#8217; you the details of my arrival?&#8221;
he asked with an effort to appear casual.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you were in some trouble, Roger.&#8221; The
girl continued to stare at him with a queer expression
in her fine eyes&ndash;&ndash;part sorrow, part concern, part
gladness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a stranger to trouble these days, Laura,&#8221;
he said soberly.</p>
<p>There was a sob in the girl&#8217;s throat, but she recovered
herself at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you eaten?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up at Joe Price&#8217;s place,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;All fed and
chipper.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not much confidence in his tone or
manner. As the girl lowered her gaze, he looked at
her hungrily; his eyes feasted on the coils of dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
hair, her long, black lashes, the curve of her cheek
and her delicate color, the full, ruby lips, and the
small, quivering chin. She was in the throes of a
strong emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Laura, if&ndash;&ndash;you didn&#8217;t want me to
come,&#8221; he said unsteadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Roger! Of course we want you to come.
It&#8217;s been so long since we saw you. And you&#8217;ve&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve
gone through so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes, and the expression which he
saw in their depths caused him to look away and to
bite his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of it I wish I could undo, Laura;
an&#8217; there&#8217;s a lot more of it I couldn&#8217;t help, an&#8217; maybe
some I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;wasn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused. He couldn&#8217;t
bring himself to say anything in extenuation of himself
and his acts in the presence of this girl. It
might sound as if he were playing for her sympathy,
he thought to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, I know you haven&#8217;t done all the things I&#8217;ve
heard about,&#8221; she said bravely. &#8220;And there&#8217;s always
a chance. You&#8217;re a man. You can find a way out.
If the trails seem all twisted and tangled, you can
use a compass&ndash;&ndash;your own conscience, Roger. You
still have that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you happen to mention the trails bein&#8217;
all mixed up like that?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know. Isn&#8217;t that the way it
seems?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn looked away with a frown. &#8220;You come
near hittin&#8217; the nail on the head, Laura.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you <i>are</i> beginning to think!&#8221; she said
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done nothing but think for months,&#8221; Rathburn
confessed.</p>
<p>She looked at him searchingly. Then her eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
dropped to the black butt of the gun in the holster
strapped to his right thigh. She shuddered slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You came from the west, Roger?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied shortly. &#8220;From where there&#8217;s
water an&#8217; timber an&#8217; flowers an&#8217; grass&ndash;&ndash;but they had
my number there, just the same as they&#8217;ve got it
here. I&#8217;m a marked man, Laura Mallory.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned upon the table with one hand; the
other she held upon her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are&ndash;&ndash;are they&ndash;&ndash;after you, Roger?&#8221; she asked in
a low, anxious tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;As usual,&#8221; he answered with a vague laugh.
&#8220;Laura, I didn&#8217;t come here to bother you with my
troubles; I come here just to see <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl colored. &#8220;I know, Roger. We&#8217;ve known
each other a long time&ndash;&ndash;since we were children. You
wouldn&#8217;t like it for me not to show any concern over
your troubles, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we could talk about something else,&#8221; said
Rathburn. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stay long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura Mallory looked worried. &#8220;May I ask where
you plan to go, Roger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. I only know I wanted to come
back, an&#8217; I came. I hadn&#8217;t any fixed plans, an&#8217; I
wasn&#8217;t expecting the reception I got.&#8221; His face
clouded. Then he looked straight into the girl&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;I hit this country this morning,&#8221; he said steadily.
&#8220;The first folks I saw was some men ridin&#8217; in my
direction up between the lava hills and the range.
Then things began to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded brightly. &#8220;I believe you,&#8221; she said
simply.</p>
<p>Rathburn smiled. &#8220;You aways did that, Laura,
an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never been much of a hand at lying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger,&#8221; she said quickly, &#8220;if they all knew you
as well as I think I know you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t believe,&#8221; he interrupted. &#8220;They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
call me The Coyote, an&#8217; they&#8217;ll have me live up to the
name whether I want to or not,&#8221; he added bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Roger, you&#8217;re forgetting what I said about
the trails and the compass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Laura, I&#8217;m not, but there&#8217;s another force besides
the big lodestone that&#8217;s affectin&#8217; that compass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, you&#8217;re thinking of an enemy!&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not answer her. His face appeared grim,
almost haggard, in the yellow rays of the lamplight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, you once promised me anything I might
ask,&#8221; she said softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; all you have to do is ask,&#8221; he answered, taking
a step toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask you for something, Roger,&#8221; she
said without looking at him. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
too much that I ask.&#8221; She glanced up at him
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Laura?&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want your gun, Roger,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>He straightened and stared at her in startled wonder.
&#8220;But, Laura&ndash;&ndash;a man in my position&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;where
would I be at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if you gave it to me it would help you
find a way out, Roger,&#8221; she pleaded earnestly.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked into her eyes and thrilled. Then
without a word he unbuckled his cartridge belt which
held his holstered gun, untied the strap about his
thigh and laid the belt with the weapon upon the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger!&#8221; said the girl. The sob again was in her
voice. She reached out and placed a hand upon his
arm.</p>
<p>An elderly man appeared in the doorway from the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, this is Roger,&#8221; said the girl hurriedly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Roger, eh? You mean Rathburn
is here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man peered at the visitor from the doorway,
his lean face twitching. He stroked his gray
beard in indecision. His blue eyes looked long at
Rathburn, then at the girl, and lastly at the gun and
belt on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hello, Rathburn,&#8221; he said finally, advancing
into the room. He held out a hand which Rathburn
grasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you eat yet?&#8221; asked Mallory.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the hills with Joe Price,&#8221; replied Rathburn.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m just as much obliged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; Mallory muttered. &#8220;With Joe,
eh? He ain&#8217;t been down in months. How is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks good as a gold mine an&#8217; thinks he&#8217;s found
one,&#8221; said Rathburn, looking at the girl&#8217;s father
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what keeps him up,&#8221; Mallory asserted
loudly. &#8220;He&#8217;ll never get old as long as he thinks he&#8217;s
got a mine corralled. He ought to try stock raisin&#8217;
for a while. You look older, Rathburn&ndash;&ndash;more filled
out. Are you still cutting &#8217;em high, wide, an&#8217; handsome?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s face clouded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger&#8217;s starting new, dad,&#8221; the girl interposed.</p>
<p>Mallory stared keenly at the younger man. He
started to speak, but was interrupted by the sound
of horses outside the house.</p>
<p>Rathburn whirled toward the door, took a step,
and stopped in his tracks. The girl&#8217;s hands flew to
the sides of her face, and her eyes widened with apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go see who it is,&#8221; said Mallory with a quick
look at Rathburn.</p>
<p>He hastened out into the kitchen, and a moment
later they heard the kitchen door open. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
murmur of voices. The girl stared at Rathburn
breathlessly, while he tapped with his slim fingers
upon the top of the table.</p>
<p>Then Mallory came in. &#8220;Somebody to see you,&#8221;
he said to Rathburn.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked once at the white-faced girl and
followed her father out into the kitchen. She heard
them speak in an undertone, and then Rathburn
came back into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much elated over my visitor,&#8221; he said
slowly. &#8220;I wish you hadn&#8217;t asked me what you did
until&ndash;&ndash;well, until this caller had come an&#8217; gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked straight into his eyes in an agony of
dread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Roger?&#8221; she asked, wetting her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike Eagen is out there,&#8221; he answered calmly.</p>
<p>She drew a quick breath, while he waited. Then
he turned on his heel and started for the kitchen
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger!&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>He swung about and eyed her questioningly. She
pointed at the heavy belt and gun on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>He buckled on the belt and tied down the end of
the holster so it could not slip if he should draw the
weapon within it. Then he made his way into the
kitchen and out of the rear door. Laura Mallory
sank into a chair, sobbing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>GUNMEN</h3>
</div>
<p>For a moment Rathburn waited at the kitchen
door. He heard Mallory going upstairs from
the next room. All was still outside, save for the
stamping of several horses. Then he suddenly opened
the door and stepped out. There was no sound or
movement, as he accustomed his eyes to the dim
light without. He moved across the threshold and
walked straight to a bulky figure standing beside a
large horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to see me, Eagen?&#8221; he asked coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch out there, Eagen!&#8221; came Mallory&#8217;s voice
in a strident tone from a window above them. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got you covered with this Winchester!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Rathburn and Eagen looked up and saw
Mallory leaning out of a window over the kitchen,
and the stock of a rifle was snug against his cheek
and shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acts like he&#8217;s scared you can&#8217;t take care of yourself,&#8221;
said Eagen with a sneer. &#8220;The way you
ditched that posse to-day I didn&#8217;t think you needed
a bodyguard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Rathburn retorted. &#8220;The old man is
acting on his own hook. You was watching the
sport to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said Eagen. &#8220;It was me an&#8217;
some of the boys they was after. You sort of
helped us out by coming along an&#8217; attracting their
attention. I pegged you when I saw you ride for it,
an&#8217; I knew they wouldn&#8217;t get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you hid an&#8217; let me stand the gaff,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
said Rathburn scornfully. &#8220;That&#8217;s your style,
Eagen. You&#8217;re plumb afraid to come out from under
cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that there were three men with Eagen.
They were quietly sitting their horses some little distance
behind their leader.</p>
<p>Eagen muttered something, and Rathburn could
see his face working with rage. Then Eagen&#8217;s
coarse features underwent a change, and he grinned,
his teeth flashing white under his small, black mustache.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Rathburn, there&#8217;s no use in you an&#8217;
me being on the outs,&#8221; he said in an undertone.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got something in common.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made a mistake already,&#8221; Rathburn interrupted
sharply. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t a thing in common I
know of, Eagen, unless it&#8217;s a gun apiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you think that&#8217;s all we need,&#8221; said Eagen
hoarsely; &#8220;an&#8217; if that&#8217;s the way you feel you won&#8217;t
find me backin&#8217; down when you start something.
Just now I ain&#8217;t forgetting that crazy fool with that
rifle up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t come here for a gun play, Eagen,&#8221;
said Rathburn. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t plumb loco <i>every</i> way.
I take it you saw me makin&#8217; for this place an&#8217; followed
me here. What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk business,&#8221; said Eagen with a hopeful
note in his voice; &#8220;but you won&#8217;t let me get
started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I won&#8217;t have dealings with you,&#8221; said Rathburn
crisply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you think,&#8221; sneered Eagen. &#8220;But
you&#8217;re in a tight corner, an&#8217; we can help you out.
Long said to-day, I heard just now, that he&#8217;d put
every deputy he had an&#8217; every man he could swear
in as a special on your trail, and he&#8217;d get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that I can&#8217;t see,&#8221; drawled Rathburn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
&#8220;is what that&#8217;s got to do with you. I suppose you&#8217;re
here as a missionary to tip me off. Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagen had calmed down. He stepped closer to
Rathburn and spoke in a low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the lay: They&#8217;re after you, an&#8217; they&#8217;re
after us. I know you&#8217;re no stool pigeon, an&#8217; I know
I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; a chance when I tell you that we&#8217;ve got
a big job comin&#8217; up&ndash;&ndash;one that&#8217;ll get us a pretty roll.
It takes nerve to pull it off, even though certain
things will make it easier. You might just as well
be in on it. You can make it a last job an&#8217; blow
these parts for good. You don&#8217;t have to come in, of
course; but it&#8217;ll be worth your while. You&#8217;ve got
the name, an&#8217; you might as well have what goes with
it. I&#8217;ll let you head the outfit an&#8217; shoot square all
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed scornfully. &#8220;When I heard you
was out here, Eagen, I guessed it was something like
this that brought you here. Maybe you&#8217;re statin&#8217;
facts as to this job which, you say, is coming up.
But you lied when you said you&#8217;d shoot square,
Eagen. I wouldn&#8217;t trust you as far as you could
throw a bull by the tail, an&#8217; there&#8217;s half a dozen other
reasons why you an&#8217; me couldn&#8217;t be pardners!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagen stepped back with a snarl of rage. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
reckon you&#8217;re entitled to what rep you&#8217;ve got!&#8221; he
blurted hoarsely. &#8220;Right down under the skin,
Rathburn, I believe you&#8217;re soft!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s puttin&#8217; it up to me all fair an&#8217; square,&#8221;
Rathburn replied evenly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it right back to
you, Eagen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that gun out of the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mallory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here, Rathburn, an&#8217; all set,&#8221; came Mallory&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that gun out of the window.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Don&#8217;t you see there&#8217;s three of &#8217;em?
You&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that gun out of the window!&#8221; rang Rathburn&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him play with it,&#8221; Eagen said harshly.</p>
<p>Mallory withdrew from the window, as Eagen
reached for his left stirrup and swung into the
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; it,&#8221; Rathburn called to him
with a jeering laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t forgettin&#8217; it?&#8221; Eagen shouted, as he
drove in his spurs.</p>
<p>His three companions galloped after him, and
Rathburn caught sight of a dark-skinned face, a pair
of beady, black eyes, and the long, drooping mustaches
of one of the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gomez!&#8221; he exclaimed to himself. &#8220;Eagen&#8217;s
takin&#8217; up with the Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mallory appeared in the kitchen door, holding a
lamp above his head. &#8220;What&#8217;d he want?&#8221; he demanded
of Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n he got,&#8221; answered Rathburn shortly.
Then he saw Laura Mallory standing behind her
father.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to say he made a little proposition that
I had to turn down,&#8221; he amended, with a direct
glance at the girl. &#8220;An&#8217; now I&#8217;ve got to do some
more ridin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You leavin&#8217; to-night?&#8221; asked Mallory in surprise.
&#8220;We can put you up here, Rathburn, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll keep
an eye out for visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;d have &#8217;em afore mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said Rathburn
grimly. &#8220;Eagen will see to it that Bob Long
knows I was out here, right pronto. But I aim
to stop any posses from botherin&#8217; around your place.
If there&#8217;s one thing I don&#8217;t want to do, Mallory,
it&#8217;s make any trouble for you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>The girl came walking toward him and touched
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, Roger?&#8221; she asked
in an anxious voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; straight into Hope,&#8221; Rathburn replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Roger,&#8221; the girl faltered, &#8220;won&#8217;t that mean&ndash;&ndash;mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A show-down? Maybe so. I ain&#8217;t side-steppin&#8217;
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A world of worry showed in the girl&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;Roger, why don&#8217;t you go away?&#8221; she asked hesitatingly.
&#8220;Things could be worse, and maybe in
time they would become better. Folks forget,
Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Rathburn&#8217;s hand rested on hers,
as he looked down at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two ways of forgettin&#8217;, girlie,&#8221; he said
soberly. &#8220;An&#8217; I don&#8217;t want &#8217;em to forget me
the wrong way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Roger, promise me you won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;turn
your gun against a man, Roger. It would
make things so much worse. It would leave&ndash;&ndash;nothing
now. Don&#8217;t you see? It takes courage
to avoid what seems to be the inevitable. That
terrible skill which is yours, the trick in this hand
on mine, is your worst enemy. Oh, Roger, if you&#8217;d
never learned to throw a gun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; he told her gently. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
what you think at all. I&#8217;d rather cut off that right
hand than have it raised unfairly against a single
living thing. They call me a gunman, girlie, an&#8217;
I reckon I am. But I&#8217;m not a killer. There&#8217;s a
difference between the two, an&#8217; sometimes I think
it&#8217;s that difference that&#8217;s makin&#8217; all the trouble. I&#8217;m
still tryin&#8217; to steer by that thing you call the compass,
an&#8217; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve got to go to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped away from her, waved a farewell to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Mallory, who was watching the scene with a puzzled
expression, and ran for his horse. A minute later
the ringing hoof beats of his mount were dying
in the still night.</p>
<p>Laura Mallory swayed, and her father hurried
to her with the lamp and put his arm about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about, sweetie?&#8221; he asked complainingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, daddy, nothing&ndash;&ndash;only I love him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A puff of wind blew out the light in the lamp,
and father and daughter stood with arms about
each other under the dancing stars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE SHERIFF&#8217;S PLIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>Riding slowly Rathburn kept well in toward
the range and proceeded cautiously. This wasn&#8217;t
alone a safety measure, for he wished to favor
his horse. The dun had been hard ridden in the
spurt to gain the mountains ahead of the posse. He
had been rested at Price&#8217;s cabin, to be sure, and
also at the Mallory ranch; but now Rathburn had
a ride of fifteen miles to the town of Hope, and
he did not know how much riding he might have
to do next day.</p>
<p>When a scant three miles from Hope, he halted,
loosened the saddle cinch, and rested his horse,
while he himself reclined on the ground and smoked
innumerable cigarettes. He was in a thoughtful
mood, serious and somewhat puzzled. The recollection
of Eagen&#8217;s proposition caused him to frown
frequently. Then a wistful light would glow in
his eyes, and he thought of Laura Mallory. This
would be succeeded by another frown, and then his
eyes would narrow, and the smile that men had
come to fear would tremble on his lips.</p>
<p>He was again in the saddle with the first faint
glimmer of the approaching dawn. He covered
the distance into Hope at a swinging lope and rode
in behind a row of neat, yellow-brick buildings
which formed the east side of one block on the
short main street.</p>
<p>Securing his horse behind a building midway
of the rear of the block, he entered one of the
buildings through a back door. It proved to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
combination pool room and soft-drink bar. No one
was in the place except the porter who was cleaning
up. Rathburn noted that the man showed no
evidences of knowing him, although this was Rathburn&#8217;s
home town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of early, ain&#8217;t you, boss?&#8221; grinned the
porter. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for something to
start the day with.&#8221; He winked broadly.</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded and walked over to the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just get in?&#8221; asked the porter, as he put out
a bottle of white liquor and glanced at the dust
on Rathburn&#8217;s clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in,&#8221; replied Rathburn, pouring and tossing
off one drink. &#8220;Where&#8217;s everybody? Too early
for &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s about an hour too early on the average,
unless there&#8217;s been an all-night game,&#8221; replied the
porter, putting the bottle away, as his customer declined
a second drink. &#8220;But then there ain&#8217;t very
many in town right now. Everybody&#8217;s out after
the reward money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn lifted his brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed the porter eagerly, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t
see any men ridin&#8217; looselike, when you was coming
in, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn shook his head. &#8220;What&#8217;s all this you&#8217;re
tryin&#8217; to chirp into my ear?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bob Long, the sheriff, has got all his
deputies out except just the jailer&ndash;&ndash;there ain&#8217;t anybody
much in jail now, anyway&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; all the other
men he could pin a star on, lookin&#8217; for a gang
that held up the stage from Sunshine yesterday
mornin&#8217;, shot the stage driver dead, an&#8217; made off
with an express package full of money. There&#8217;s a
big reward out for the man that&#8217;s leadin&#8217; the gang.
He&#8217;s called The Coyote. Used to live here. He&#8217;s a
bad one.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff out, too?&#8221; Rathburn asked, showing great
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Come back in early last night an&#8217; got
more men. They&#8217;re tryin&#8217; to surround Imagination
Range, I guess. That&#8217;s where this Coyote an&#8217; his
gang are supposed to be hanging out. The sheriff
don&#8217;t care so much for the fellers that&#8217;s with him,
I guess, but he sure does want this Coyote person.
He told everybody to let the gang go if they had to,
but to get the leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn looked through the front windows with
a quizzical smile on his lips. The sun was shining
in the deserted street.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men has the sheriff got?&#8221; he inquired
casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most two hundred, I guess. They&#8217;re scattered
all over the range, an&#8217; a lot of &#8217;em has hit over
on the other side. They think The Coyote crossed
the range an&#8217; is makin&#8217; east.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe he has, an&#8217; maybe he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Rathburn
observed. &#8220;The best place to hide from a
posse is in the middle of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The porter looked at him, then burst into a loud
laugh. &#8220;I guess you said something that time,
pardner. In the middle of it, eh?&#8221; He went about
his work, chuckling, while Rathburn walked to a
front window and stood looking out.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he stepped quickly back into
a corner, as a small automobile raced up the street.
He sauntered to the rear door, passed out with a
pleasant word to the porter, and when he gained
the open, hurried up behind the buildings the length
of the block. There he turned to the left and
walked rapidly to a large stone building. He went
around on the east side and entered a door on the
ground floor. He found himself in a hallway, and
on his left was a door, on the glazed glass of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
upper half of which was the gold lettering: &#8220;Sheriff&#8217;s
Office.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s hesitation he opened the door
quickly and went in. A man standing before an
open roll-top desk turned and regarded the early-morning
visitor. He was a small man, but of wiry
build. His eyes were gray, and he wore a small,
brown mustache. He had a firm chin, and his face
was well tanned. He was holding a paper in his
hands, and the paper remained as steady as a rock
in his grasp. His eyes bored straight and unflinchingly
into Rathburn&#8217;s. He showed no surprise, no
concern. He made no move toward the pair of
guns in the holsters of the belt which reposed on
top of his desk. He spoke first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come to give yourself up, Rathburn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly that, sheriff,&#8221; replied Rathburn cheerfully.
&#8220;I arrived in town this morning after most
of the population had moved to the desert and the
country aroun&#8217; Imagination. I didn&#8217;t think I was
goin&#8217; to be lucky enough to catch you in till I saw
you arrive in that flivver. Are you back for more
recruits?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff continued to hold the paper without
moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you first started to talk, Rathburn, I
thought maybe bravado had brought you here to
make a grand-stand play,&#8221; he said coolly. &#8220;But I
see you&#8217;re not as foolhardy as some might think.
I always gave you credit for being clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Sheriff Long,&#8221; said Rathburn dryly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a few preliminaries we&#8217;ve got to get over,
so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His gun leaped into his hand and instantly covered
the official. He stepped to the end of the
desk, reached over and appropriated the belt with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
the two guns with his left hand. He tossed the
belt and weapons to a vacant chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sheriff, I didn&#8217;t come lookin&#8217; for a cell
like you hinted; I drifted in for a bit of information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is headquarters for that article, especially
if it&#8217;s about yourself,&#8221; said Long, dropping the
paper on his desk and sitting down in the chair
before it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What all have you got against me?&#8221; frowned
Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; said the sheriff with biting
sarcasm; &#8220;just a few killings, highway robbery,
a bank stick-up, two or three gaming houses looted,
and a stage holdup. Enough to keep you in the
Big House for ninety-nine years and then hang you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;re sure an ambitious
man, sheriff. The killings now&ndash;&ndash;there was White
and Moran, that you know about, an&#8217; a skunk over
in California named Carlisle, that you don&#8217;t know
about, I guess. I couldn&#8217;t get away from those
shootings, sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Simpson and Manley?&#8221; countered the
official scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on my list,&#8221; said Rathburn quickly. &#8220;I
heard I was given credit for those affairs, but I
wasn&#8217;t a member of the party where they were
snuffed out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can make a jury believe that, you&#8217;re in
the clear,&#8221; said Long. &#8220;But how about that stage
driver yesterday morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;I got in from the
west just in time to stumble on that gang of rats,&#8221;
he flared. &#8220;That&#8217;s how your men came to see me.
The chase happened to come in my direction,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can prove that, you&#8217;re all right again,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
the sheriff pointed out. &#8220;The law will go halfway
with you, Rathburn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to prove it,&#8221;
said Rathburn bitterly. &#8220;Those other things&ndash;&ndash;the
bank job an&#8217; the gamblin&#8217; stick-ups&ndash;&ndash;I was younger
then, sheriff, an&#8217; no one can say that that bank
sharp didn&#8217;t do me dirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can show a good, reasonable doubt in
those other cases, Rathburn, I know the court would
show leniency if the jury found you guilty on the
counts you just mentioned,&#8221; said the sheriff earnestly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m minded to believe you, so far as yesterday&#8217;s
work was concerned. I have an idea or two myself,
but I haven&#8217;t been able to get a good line
on my man. He&#8217;s too tricky. Of course I&#8217;m not
going to urge you to do anything against your
will. I appreciate your position. You&#8217;re a fugitive,
but you have your liberty. Perhaps you can get
away clean, though I doubt it. But there&#8217;s that
chance, and you&#8217;ve naturally got to take it into
consideration. And you&#8217;re not <i>sure</i> of anything if
you go to trial on the charges there are against
you. But it would count like sixty in your favor,
Rathburn, if you&#8217;d give yourself up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn stared at the official speculatively. His
thoughts flashed back along the years to the time
when he and Laura Mallory had played together as
children. He thought of what she had said the
night before about the compass. He shifted uneasily
on his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny thing, sheriff, but I had some such fool
notion,&#8221; he confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes nerve, Rathburn, for a man who is
wanted to walk in and give up his gun,&#8221; said the
sheriff quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of something else,&#8221; said Rathburn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got to think some more about this
that you&#8217;ve sort of put in my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much time do you want, Rathburn?&#8221; asked
Long.</p>
<p>Rathburn scowled. &#8220;Our positions haven&#8217;t
changed,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;I&#8217;m still the man you&#8217;re
lookin&#8217; for. I&#8217;ll have to do my thinkin&#8217; on my own
hook, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say,&#8221; Long said gravely. &#8220;Go
over what I&#8217;ve told you carefully and don&#8217;t make
any more false moves while you&#8217;re making up your
mind. You wounded one of my men yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shot high on purpose,&#8221; Rathburn pointed out.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t aim to be corralled just then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you did,&#8221; was the sheriff&#8217;s rejoinder. &#8220;I
know you could have killed him. I gave you credit
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You give me credit for quite a few things,
sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn whimsically. &#8220;An&#8217; now
you&#8217;ll have to give me credit for bein&#8217; plumb cautious.
It ain&#8217;t my intention to have my thinking
spell disturbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>His gun flashed in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask you to go inside an&#8217; occupy one
of your own cells, sheriff, while I&#8217;m wanderin&#8217;
around an&#8217; debatin&#8217; the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you too well, Rathburn,&#8221; said the sheriff
with a grim smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m not armed, and I don&#8217;t
intend to obey you. If you intend to shoot you
might just as well start!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn gazed at him coolly for a moment;
then he shoved his gun in its holster and leaped.</p>
<p>Quick as he was, Long was quicker. The sheriff
was out of his chair in a twinkling, and he made
a flying tackle, grasping Rathburn about the legs.
The two fell to the floor and rolled over and over
in their struggles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>Although Rathburn was the larger man, the sheriff
seemed made of steel wire. He twisted out of
Rathburn&#8217;s holds, one after another. In one great
effort he freed himself and leaped to his feet.
Rathburn was up instantly. Long drove a straight
right that grazed Rathburn&#8217;s jaw and staggered
him, but Rathburn blocked the next blow and succeeded
in upper-cutting his left to the sheriff&#8217;s chin.</p>
<p>They went into another clinch, and the sheriff
got the better of the close fighting. Rathburn&#8217;s
face was bleeding, where it had been cut on a leg
of the chair, when they were struggling on the
floor. The feel of trickling crimson drove him
mad. He threw Long off in an amazing burst
of strength and then sent his right to the sheriff&#8217;s
jaw with all the force he could put into it.</p>
<p>Long dropped to the floor, and Rathburn raised
him and carried him to a door leading into the jail
proper. As he drew open the door, he drew his
gun and threw it down on the astonished jailer who
was dozing in the little office outside the bars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open up!&#8221; Rathburn commanded.</p>
<p>The jailer hastened to obey, as he saw the appearance
of Rathburn&#8217;s face and the dangerous look in
his eyes.</p>
<p>Rathburn compelled him at the point of his gun
to lead the way to a cell in the rear, unlock it,
and go inside. Rathburn pushed Long, who was
regaining his senses, in after him and took the
jailer&#8217;s keys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Long I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; over what he told me,&#8221;
he said to the jailer, as he locked them in.</p>
<p>Then he hurried back to the entrance, locked it,
and tossed the keys in through the bars.</p>
<p>He wet his handkerchief with ice water from a
tank in Long&#8217;s office, wiped his face clean, and left
the building.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>A NEW COUNT</h3>
</div>
<p>As Rathburn wended his way to an obscure
restaurant on a side street of the little town
which was the county seat of Mesquite County, his
thoughts were busy with what he had learned
from the sheriff. He knew the official had been
right when he said that it would react in Rathburn&#8217;s
favor if he gave himself up. Some of the counts
on which he would be indicted undoubtedly would
be quashed; others he might disprove. There was
a chance that he might get off lightly; in any event
he would have to spend a number of years in
prison.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked up at the bright sky. At the
end of the street he could see the desert, and far
beyond, the blue outlines of the mountains. It
seemed to him that the sunshine was brighter on
this deadly morning when he struggled with troubled
thoughts. Having always lived in the open, liberty
meant everything to him.</p>
<p>But constantly his thoughts reverted to Laura
Mallory. What did she expect of him? What
would she think if he were to give himself up?
Her talk of the compass&ndash;&ndash;his conscience&ndash;&ndash;bothered
him. Why should she say such a thing if she
didn&#8217;t feel more than a friendly interest in him?
Did she care for him then?</p>
<p>Rathburn laughed mirthlessly, as he entered the
eating house. There was no doubt of it&ndash;&ndash;he was
a fool. He continued to think, as he ate; by the
time he had finished he found himself in a bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
mental state. He wiped some moisture from his
forehead, as he left the restaurant. For a moment
he felt panicky. He was wavering!</p>
<p>The tenor of his thoughts caused him to abandon
his caution. He turned the corner by the State
Bank of Hope and walked boldly down the street.
Few pedestrians were about. None took any special
notice of him, and none recognized him. He turned
in at the resort he had visited when he first arrived
that morning.</p>
<p>He started, as he entered the place. A deep
frown gathered on his face. Gomez, Eagen&#8217;s Mexican
henchman, was at the bar. At first Rathburn
feigned ignorance of the Mexican&#8217;s presence; but
Gomez smiled at him, his white teeth glistening
against his swarthy skin.</p>
<p>Rathburn marveled at the audacity of the Mexican,
who undoubtedly was one of those who had held
up the stage the day before, in coming boldly into
town. Then he recollected that the sheriff had mentioned
he had an idea of who was responsible for
that job, but had been unable to get a line on his
man. Eagen and his gang were evidently well
covered up. If such were the case, Eagen himself
might be in town.</p>
<p>It was because he thought he might learn something
from Gomez that he finally acknowledged the
fellow&#8217;s greeting by a nod.</p>
<p>The Mexican left the bar and walked up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not afraid to come in town, Mr. Coyote,&#8221;
he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop that name,&#8221; said Rathburn sharply in an
undertone. &#8220;Is Eagen here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is here,&#8221; replied Gomez with another display
of his white teeth. &#8220;You want to see him?
He is up talking with Mr. Doane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doane! Rathburn remembered the name instantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
as being the same which had been spoken by Laura
Mallory the night before. He remembered, too, the
man who had been there and who had driven away
to town in the little car. He surmised that this
man had been Doane; and it had been he who had
brought the information of Rathburn&#8217;s arrival and
the posse&#8217;s pursuit to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to see him?&#8221; asked Gomez craftily.</p>
<p>Rathburn had a consuming aversion for the wily
Mexican. He hated the shifty look in his eyes
and his oily tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he answered shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be here maybe,&#8221; said Gomez eagerly. &#8220;It
is you change your mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn scowled. The Mexican then knew
all about the proposition Eagen had made to him
the night before. Perhaps he could get more information
from him than he had suspected.</p>
<p>&#8220;What job is it Eagen is planning?&#8221; he asked
in a low voice.</p>
<p>There were several men at the bar now, and
both Rathburn and the Mexican were keeping an
eye upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that he will have to tell you himself when
you are ready,&#8221; Gomez replied.</p>
<p>Rathburn snorted in keen disgust. But Gomez
sidled up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to the Mallory rancho last night,&#8221; he
whispered. &#8220;You are not the only one there last
night.&#8221; His smile flashed again, as Rathburn looked
at him quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was another there before,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;Mr. Doane. He goes there, too. You have been
away a long time, and Mr. Doane take the advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes were narrowing, and the Mexican
evidently took his face for an encouraging sign.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Doane&ndash;&ndash;he is not lucky at cards,&#8221; continued
Gomez. &#8220;He like to play, and he play lots; but
not too well. Maybe he have more luck in love&ndash;&ndash;while
you are away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Rathburn through
his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you do not know?&#8221; The Mexican raised
his black brows. &#8220;While you are away, Mr. Doane
make hay while the sun shine bright. He was
there much. He was there last night before you.
He tries hard to steal your se&ntilde;orita before you
come, and he will try to keep her now.&#8221; He winked
slyly.</p>
<p>Rathburn suddenly grasped him by the throat.
&#8220;What are you tryin&#8217; to say?&#8221; he asked sternly,
shaking the Mexican like a rat.</p>
<p>Gomez broke away, his black eyes darting fire.
&#8220;You are a fool!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You get nothing.
Even your woman, she is stole right under your
eyes. Doane, he goes there, and he gets her. She
fall for him fast. Then she talks to you with
sugar in her mouth, and you believe. Bah! You
think the Se&ntilde;orita Mallory&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s open palm crashed against the Mexican&#8217;s
mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak her name, you greaser!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gomez staggered back under the force of the slap.
His eyes were pin points of fire. He raised his
right hand to his mouth and then to the brim of his
sombrero. His breath came in hissing gasps, as
the hatred blazed in his glittering eyes.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s face was white under its heavy coating
of tan. He saw the few men at the bar turn
and look in their direction, and he realized instinctively
that these men were gamblers and shady
characters who were probably friends of Eagen and
his gang.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I give you my regards,&#8221; cried Gomez in a frenzy
of rage. &#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;gringo!&#8221;</p>
<p>His right hand tipped his sombrero in a lightning
move, and there was a flash in the sunlight filtering
through the back windows, as Rathburn&#8217;s gun barked
at his hip.</p>
<p>Gomez crumpled backward to the floor, as the
knife dropped from his grasp at the beginning of
the throw.</p>
<p>Rathburn, still holding his smoking gun ready,
walked rapidly past the men at the bar and gained
the open through the door at the rear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>THE COMPASS FAILS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the alley behind the buildings fronting on the
main street, Rathburn paused in indecision, while
he shoved his gun into the holster on his thigh. He
had known by the look in Gomez&#8217;s eyes that he was
going to throw a knife. Instinct had caused him to
watch the Mexican&#8217;s right hand, and, in the instant
when Gomez had secured the knife from his
hat and snapped back his hand for the throw, Rathburn
had drawn and fired. He knew well the
dexterity of a man of Gomez&#8217;s stamp with a knife.
The gun route was the only chance to protect his
life. But Rathburn realized, too, that he had shot to
kill!</p>
<p>He had been incensed by the Mexican&#8217;s subtle
insinuations&ndash;&ndash;maddened by the way he leered when
he spoke Laura Mallory&#8217;s name. He had virtually
been driven to it. Even now he could not see how
he could have avoided it.</p>
<p>Securing his horse, Rathburn rode swiftly around
a back street to a small barn on the edge of the
desert. He ordered his mount watered and fed.
He had known the man who owned this barn,
but the individual who attended to his horse was
a new employee. He sat in the little front office
which also served as the quarters of the night man,
while his horse was being looked after. He had
not removed his saddle.</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s thoughts dwelt on what Gomez had
said. There was no question but that the Mexican
had taken liberties in saying what he did, but there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
was more than a glimmer of truth in his statements.
Rathburn had seen the man leaving Laura
Mallory on the porch of the Mallory ranch house.
She had mentioned a man named Doane as having
brought word that he, Rathburn, was back in the
country and in more trouble. Now Gomez had
identified this visitor as Doane, the man who had
been calling on Laura Mallory regularly. Rathburn&#8217;s
brows wrinkled at the thought. But why
not? What hold had he upon her? It certainly
wasn&#8217;t within his rights to resent the fact that
another man had found the girl attractive. But,
to his increasing torment, he found that he <i>did</i> resent
it; he couldn&#8217;t help it!</p>
<p>Suddenly he remembered that Gomez had said
Eagen was paying a call on Doane. What could
Eagen have to do with Doane which would warrant
his visiting him early in the morning? Rathburn
recalled that Gomez had intimated that Doane liked
to play cards. Was the man then a professional
gambler? But no, Gomez had said he did not
play well.</p>
<p>Rathburn tried to recollect where he had seen
this man Doane before. The blond face and mustache
were vaguely familiar. Again he strove to
place the man without result.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, drew out his gun,
and replaced the empty shell with a fresh cartridge.
He dropped the weapon back into his holster and
went outside to see about his horse. The dun still
was feeding. Rathburn contented himself with looking
over his saddle and readjusting the small slicker
pack on its rear. Then he paced the length of the
barn, frowning in a thoughtful mood.</p>
<p>There was only one thing he was reasonably sure
of; no one around the town knew that he was the
outlaw known as The Coyote. He had not seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
anybody he knew except the sheriff, and that official
was safely out of the way for the present. Gomez
had mentioned his name when they had first met,
but he had not been heard save by Rathburn. Therefore,
if they were looking for the man who had
shot down Gomez, they were merely looking for a
man measuring up to his description; and Rathburn
doubted if anything would be done until the authorities
had been notified. Visitors to the sheriff&#8217;s
office would find Long out and would assume that
he had not returned from the chase in the hills.
It might be another hour before the sheriff&#8217;s predicament
was discovered. And in that hour&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Rathburn caught himself up with another shrug.
He was falling a prey to his former hopeless trend
of thought. Resentment was swelling within him
again, and he struggled to put it down. Perhaps
it would be safer to yield to the inclination to take
a chance on the courts.</p>
<p>It was after nine o&#8217;clock when he rode out of the
barn. He proceeded straight toward the main street
of the town. He was struggling with a half-formed
resolve; summoning courage by shutting out all recollections
save that of Laura Mallory&#8217;s apparently
earnest remark about the compass.</p>
<p>Reaching the main street, he started to turn the
corner at the bank building when he suddenly checked
his horse and stared at two people walking up the
opposite side of the street. Rathburn recognized
the girl immediately. She was Laura Mallory. A
moment later he caught a glimpse of the man&#8217;s face,
as he half turned toward Rathburn, laughing. He
had taken Laura&#8217;s arm. It was Doane!</p>
<p>The realization that Laura had come to town
and was in the company of Doane stunned Rathburn.
More than anything else it had the effect
of convincing him that Gomez had been right when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
he had hinted that Doane was successful in love.
Hadn&#8217;t she told him to take his gun when Eagen
had been waiting for him? Had she thought, perhaps,
that there would be gun play, and that Eagen
might emerge the victor, thus assuring her that he,
Rathburn, would bother her no more?</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s eyes narrowed, and his face froze,
as he watched Laura and Doane out of sight up
the street. He knew now why he had had to come
back. There was nothing left&ndash;&ndash;nothing but his
dreams, his sinister reputation, and his gun!</p>
<p>He looked about in a different way from that
in which he had first surveyed the street, now showing
life. His gaze encountered the bank building.
The door was open. The bank doubtless opened
at nine o&#8217;clock. He remembered that this was so.
A second of indecision, then he moved in front
of the bank. He dismounted, flung the reins over
the dun&#8217;s head, and entered briskly.</p>
<p>Two men were behind the screens of the two
cages. Rathburn approached a window and nodded
to the man behind it. Then his gun leaped into
his hand, and he covered the pair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reach high an&#8217; hard!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;An&#8217;
quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>The men in the cages hesitated; but the look in
Rathburn&#8217;s eyes convinced them, and they raised their
hands over their heads. Rathburn leaped to the
ledge outside the window and climbed nimbly over
the wire network of the cage. Then he dropped
to the floor inside.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXIII_FAST_WORK' id='CHAPTER_XXXIII_FAST_WORK'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>FAST WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>Quickly and methodically Rathburn went about
his work. His face was drawn and pale, but
his eyes glittered with a deadly earnestness which
was not lost upon the two men who obeyed his orders
without question. The very boldness of his
intrepid undertaking must have convinced them that
here was no common bandit. He herded them
back toward the vault at the point of his gun. Then
he ordered them into the vault.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; he said crisply, &#8220;you know what I&#8217;m
after. Trot it out!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the men, evidently an assistant cashier
or head teller, who was in charge, opened a compartment
of the inner safe and pulled out a drawer.
Rathburn could see the packages of bills. He looked
quickly about and saw a pile of empty coin sacks
on a shelf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fill two of those large sacks,&#8221; he instructed
the other man.</p>
<p>The clerk hastened to carry out his orders and
jammed package after package of bills into one of
the largest of the coin sacks. Both men were white-faced
and frightened. They did not try to delay
the proceedings. Rathburn looked dangerous; and
what was more sinister, he went about his nefarious
business in a cool, calm, confident manner. He
did not look like the Rathburn who had visited
Laura Mallory the night before, nor the Rathburn
who had talked with the sheriff. In this critical
moment he was in look, mood, and gesture The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Coyote at his worst&ndash;&ndash;worthy of all the terrible
things that had been whispered about him.</p>
<p>It may be that the bank employees suspected as
much. It may be that they didn&#8217;t believe it would
be possible for the outlaw to make his get-away in
broad daylight, and it was certain that they stood
in mighty fear of him. They cowered back, pale and
shaking, as he calmly took the sack, heavy with its
weight of bank notes of healthy denomination, and
stepped to the entrance to the big vault.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they come an&#8217; let you out,&#8221; said Rathburn,
&#8220;you can tell them that the gent who helped
himself to the berries in the cash box is just beginnin&#8217;
to cash in on the reputation that&#8217;s been wished on
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled grimly, as he swung the light, inner
door of the vault shut and clamped down the lever.
He slid his gun into its holster and, carrying the
sack of loot, walked out of the door of the second
cage toward the main entrance of the bank. As
he reached the door, a man came up the steps.
Rathburn recognized Doane, and his lips curled
in a snarl. It was the first time Doane had come
face to face with him, but the man started back in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rathburn!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Rathburn hesitated. His first feeling of instinctive
animosity fled. He scowled in a swift effort to
place the man, and the thought that in an indirect
way Doane was partly responsible for what had
come to pass flashed through his tortured brain.
This brought swift comprehension of his immediate
danger. Now that he had taken the decisive step
he would have to call upon all his resources of
courage and cunning to protect his liberty. The die
had been cast!</p>
<p>He hurried past Doane, swung into the saddle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
and rode at a swift pace around the corner, leaving
Doane standing on the steps of the bank, staring
after him with an expression of amazement on his
face.</p>
<p>Rathburn knew it would be but a matter of a
very few minutes before the knowledge that the
State Bank of Hope had been held up and robbed&ndash;&ndash;would
be common property in the town. The very
boldness of the robbery had insured its success,
for none would dream that a lone bandit would
have the nerve to come into town in broad daylight,
hold up the bank, and attempt to run for it across
the open, burning spaces of the desert. But he was
not aware of the coincidence which would make the
news of the robbery known sooner than he expected.</p>
<p>At the end of the side street he struck boldly
across the desert, driving in his spurs and urging
the gallant dun to its top speed. In a matter of minutes
he was out of view of the town&ndash;&ndash;a speck bobbing
amid the clumps of mesquite, palo verde, and
cactus. He raced for the mountains in the northwest.</p>
<p>There was another element of uncertainty which
entered into the probability of quick pursuit, as he
had shrewdly divined. It might be some time before
the sheriff&#8217;s predicament was discovered. Meanwhile
most of the male population was scouring
the vicinity of Imagination Range looking for him,
and there would be no one to lead a second posse
until the sheriff was liberated. There was nothing
in sight behind him toward town except the vista
of dry desert vegetation swimming in the heat.
Rathburn rode on with a feeling of security, so
far as trouble from that quarter was concerned.</p>
<p>His thoughts were in a turmoil, and he passed
a shaking hand over his damp brow. The resentment
had given way to grim decision and determination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Well, he had shown them what The Coyote
could do. They would remember that job; they
could lay that at his door. The proceeds would
carry him a long way. They had given him his
reputation, and he would make the game worth the
candle!</p>
<p>The old fierce defiance of misguided youth was
in his veins. He felt a wild exultation seize him.
Doubt and all problems were set aside. His eyes
glowed with a reckless light, as he raced on toward
the blue hills.</p>
<p>Doane had known him&ndash;&ndash;had called him by name.
Therefore Doane knew he was The Coyote&ndash;&ndash;the
outlaw with a price on his head. So much the better.
He <i>wanted</i> them to know!</p>
<p>The sun was at its zenith, as he passed above the
Mallory place. He did not once turn his head
and look down upon it. His jaw was squared, his
lips pressed tight, as he guided his horse into the
winding foothills of the range. In a narrow ca&ntilde;on
he dismounted and undid his slicker pack. When
he again tied it behind the saddle it contained the
bag which held the bank notes he had taken that
morning. He pushed on in the early afternoon.</p>
<p>He now rode with more caution. The fact that
he had not seen any members of the posses which
were scouring the hills, he accredited to ignorance
on their part of the fact that he had been at the
Mallory ranch the night before and had gone into
town. These things they had hardly had time to
learn. More than likely they had assumed that he
had crossed the mountains, and it was possible
that most of the men on the hunt were on the
east side of the range. He became more and more
convinced of this as the afternoon wore on, but
he did not relax his vigilance. His face had clouded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We made a mistake, hoss,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;in
not remembering to hunt up Mike Eagen first thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the quick moves following his sudden momentous
decision, he had forgotten Eagen. This fact
now bothered him. He had a score to settle with
Eagen on general principles. This did not mean
that he necessarily would have to shoot Eagen down;
but he wanted Eagen to hear straight out what he
thought of him. It might be a long time before
he could gratify that desire after the events of
this day.</p>
<p>Slowly he proceeded, not once venturing upon a
high spot until he had investigated by crawling to a
vantage point on his hands and knees. It was
sundown when he saw the first riders. Two were
farther down the slopes to westward, and several
more were far to eastward. It was true then that
Long had thrown a cordon about the section of
the mountains which he had been seen to enter the
day before.</p>
<p>However, Rathburn&#8217;s knowledge of the range and
the secrets of the mountain trails gave him a distinct
advantage over the inexperienced members of the
posses. True, there were deputies and some others
who were experienced; but they were in the minority.</p>
<p>Rathburn realized that the sheriff must have been
released some hours before, and that his escapade
of the morning would stimulate the man hunt. The
rewards would be increased, and every able-bodied
man in Hope would doubtless join in the scramble
for the reward money. He was satisfied that Sheriff
Long&#8217;s order would be to &#8220;shoot on sight!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the very crest of the range he paused in
the shelter of the rocks. There still was a fair
chance for him to get away clean to eastward.
The sheriff had not had time to get more men over
there, and by making a break into the southeast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
and then cutting straight to the east, there was a
strong possibility that he would succeed in circling
around the posse and effect his escape.</p>
<p>But something was drawing him to Joe Price!
He did not quite understand that it was the desire
to confide in and confess to his friend what had
actuated his choice of moral trails. But the yearning
was there, and he was yielding to it. He conjectured
shrewdly that Long might not dream that
he would have the temerity again to enter the
very district where he was being sought. It was
his belief that the best place to hide from a posse
was in the midst of it!</p>
<p>It was this confidence, almost as much as his
skill in trailing, which enabled him to gain a point
above Joe Price&#8217;s cabin in the early twilight. He
waited patiently until the curtain of night had
fallen, and the stars had replaced the fading banners
of the sunset, before he slipped down a steep slope
and walked his horse into the ca&ntilde;on below the old
miner&#8217;s abode.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>THE COMPASS WAVERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Joe Price regarded Rathburn with a curious
look in his eyes when he beheld him in the
doorway of his cabin. He stepped swiftly to the
one window, which was over the table, and dropped
the burlap shade. Then he closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they&#8217;ve been here?&#8221; asked Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could you expect?&#8221; replied Price
testily. &#8220;They&#8217;re combin&#8217; these hills for you.&#8221; He
looked at Rathburn keenly, but Rathburn only smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not news to me,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
percolated through their lines twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here,&#8221; said Price, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll look after your
horse&ndash;&ndash;or were you hidin&#8217; up all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; answered Rathburn grimly.</p>
<p>The old man looked at him curiously; then he
went out of the door, closing it carefully after him.</p>
<p>Rathburn found cold food, put it on the table,
and sat down to eat. When Price returned he had
finished. The old miner sat down in a chair opposite
Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, out with it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something has
happened. I can see it in the way you look an&#8217;
act. What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn carefully rolled a brown-paper cigarette,
snapped a match into flame, and lit it before he
replied. He was half smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I held up the State Bank of Hope this mornin&#8217;
an&#8217; extracted a bag of perfectedly good bills,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t bother with the counter money.
Made &#8217;em serve me from the vault.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>Joe Price&#8217;s eyelids did not even flicker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any idear what you got?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not whatsoever,&#8221; replied Rathburn coolly; &#8220;but
the smallest I saw on top of the package was a
fifty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Price nodded. &#8220;You got plenty,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rathburn scowled. He had expected some kind
of an outbreak&ndash;&ndash;at least a remonstrance from his
old friend. He glanced about uneasily and then
glared defiance at Price.</p>
<p>&#8220;It had to come, Joe,&#8221; he asserted. &#8220;There
wasn&#8217;t any way out of it. What&#8217;s more, I killed
that greased pard of Eagen&#8217;s, Gomez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; queried Price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell <i>you</i>, Joe, but I don&#8217;t expect it to
go any further. He said something about Laura
Mallory an&#8217; a man named Doane, an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t like
it. I slapped him. Then he went for a knife he
had in his hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man nodded again. &#8220;I see,&#8221; he said
simply. &#8220;You shot him. Not a bad riddance. How
did you come to rob the bank, Rathburn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn&#8217;s gaze again shifted uneasily. Then
he rose with a burning look at Price, walked up
and down the slanting length of the cabin, and
halted before the old miner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; he said in a tremulous voice, &#8220;it&#8217;s the last
ditch. I can&#8217;t get away from it. I thought I could
tell you&ndash;&ndash;an old friend&ndash;&ndash;the whole story, but I can&#8217;t,
Joe. That&#8217;s the devil of it! There&#8217;s something
wrong with me. I reckon I&#8217;m one of those fellows
who just had everything mapped out for him. I
had some trouble, Joe, an&#8217; it&#8217;s started something&ndash;&ndash;something
I can&#8217;t control. They <i>had</i> to remember
me, an&#8217; I gave them something to remember me by!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you mean by &#8216;they,&#8217; Rathburn?&#8221; asked
the miner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff Long an&#8217; the others,&#8221; said Rathburn
quickly. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a chance for me. Why, I
was thinking of giving myself up only this morning.
Joe, it ain&#8217;t in the pictures&ndash;&ndash;not after I let Gomez
have it. Even after I stopped Gomez I had an idea
that I could face the music. Besides, Joe, there&#8217;s
more to this than you think. They call me The
Coyote, an&#8217;, Joe, so help me, from now on I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you stop at the Mallory place?&#8221; asked Price
quietly.</p>
<p>Rathburn did not reply at once. With agony in
his eyes he looked at his old friend, and suddenly
he bristled:</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well never have gone there,&#8221; he
flung out. &#8220;I see now I wasn&#8217;t wanted. I found
out as much from Gomez. He told me about Laura&#8217;s
affair with that fellow Doane. But what could I
expect? I wasn&#8217;t entitled to no thought from her,
an&#8217; I should have known as much. I&#8217;m just a
plain fool&ndash;&ndash;a worse one now than I was before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Price&#8217;s faded blue eyes glowed with comprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought Laura had put you off, so you
gave in an&#8217; robbed the bank, Rathburn, an&#8217; just
naturally made a mess of things when you had a
chance,&#8221; said the old man stoutly. &#8220;That ain&#8217;t
actin&#8217; with a lick of sense. You wasn&#8217;t gettin&#8217;
square with anybody, an&#8217; you wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; that girl
right by takin&#8217; the word of Gomez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the two of them, her an&#8217; Doane, in Hope
this morning, walkin&#8217; down the street, arm in arm,
laughing&ndash;&ndash;probably over me,&#8221; Rathburn replied bitterly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got eyes, and I can put two an&#8217; two
together. I&#8217;m only The Coyote with her, and I&#8217;ll <i>be</i>
The Coyote. She took my gun an&#8217; then gave it
back when Mike Eagen showed up, thinkin&#8217; maybe
there&#8217;d be gun play, an&#8217; I&#8217;d get mine.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now you shet up!&#8221; shrilled Price. &#8220;I reckon
you&#8217;ve lost all the brains you ever did have? Do
you think Laura would keep your gun, knowin&#8217;
there might be trouble, an&#8217; you wouldn&#8217;t have any
way to protect yourself? Don&#8217;t you suppose she
knows you&#8217;re as fast as Eagen? She&#8217;s no fool,
if you are. But, if you&#8217;ve got to stay the fool,
you better be lightin&#8217; out with your winnings. An&#8217;
you&#8217;re not takin&#8217; the bank&#8217;s money, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; scowled Rathburn,
who had been thoughtful while his friend was
speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had money in that bank, Rathburn, an&#8217; so
did Mallory, an&#8217; there&#8217;s a lot more of us&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you back your money,&#8221; Rathburn
growled. &#8220;Anyway, they&#8217;re protected by insurance,
an&#8217; the insurance people can hunt me till doomsday&ndash;&ndash;I
guess.&#8221; He was cooling off rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they are,&#8221; said Price, &#8220;an&#8217; maybe they
ain&#8217;t. But it ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to help you none the
way you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to feel about it later, no matter
who loses it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn was pacing the room, frowning. Twice
he started to speak, but the words failed to come.
Then he put a question. &#8220;Who is this man Doane?
He knew me, for I met him when I was comin&#8217;
out of the bank, an&#8217; he called me by name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doane is cashier of the bank down at Hope.
He was likely just comin&#8217; to work when you met
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn stared with an incredulous expression.
&#8220;You&#8217;re sure?&#8221; But even as he put the question,
Rathburn placed his man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dead certain on it,&#8221; declared Price.</p>
<p>Rathburn sat down heavily and took his hat in
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes it different,&#8221; he said dully, as if to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
himself. &#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s stuck on him for his money,
an&#8217; maybe she&#8217;s stuck on him because he&#8217;s a good
guy. Maybe this thing would hurt him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d blame him,&#8221; said Price
with a note of consolation in his voice; &#8220;an&#8217; he
probably wouldn&#8217;t lose nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she might think&ndash;&ndash;it might be that she&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
Rathburn swung his hat to his head and rose. He
walked toward the door, but Joe Price got in his
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Mallory ranch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get there!&#8221; said Price hoarsely, pushing
him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get there!&#8221; answered Rathburn grimly,
pushing the old man aside. &#8220;I must see Laura.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got here just by luck,&#8221; Price pointed out.
&#8220;An&#8217; there&#8217;s more men in by now. Maybe they
know you&#8217;re here. But wait till I get your horse&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s
hid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get him,&#8221; Rathburn commanded.</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s hesitation Price went out the
door, and he returned almost instantly. He walked
to the table and blew out the light. &#8220;Go to the
door an&#8217; see,&#8221; he urged in an excited voice.</p>
<p>Rathburn hurried out. High on the mountain
above the ca&ntilde;on a fire was burning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the signal,&#8221; Price whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, do me a last favor,&#8221; said Rathburn in a
queer voice. &#8220;Get me my hoss before it&#8217;s too late!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man obediently slipped into the shadows
behind the cabin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>GUNS IN THE NIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>When Joe Price returned, leading Rathburn&#8217;s
horse which he had fed and watered, and
turned over the reins, he spoke swiftly in a low
voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be watchin&#8217; hard for you down the ca&ntilde;on,
boy. Bob Long&#8217;s sure to mean business this &#8217;ere
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know it,&#8221; said Rathburn with a low,
mirthless laugh. &#8220;I locked him in his own jail
this mornin&#8217; to get a clean chance to decide to
give myself up. Then, when the chance came&ndash;&ndash;well,
he surely thinks now that I put him away
to cover my tracks. I expect the boys have got
their shootin&#8217; orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; whispered Price excitedly. &#8220;Wait till
I get my own horse, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll strike east across the
hump. That&#8217;ll start &#8217;em after me maybe&ndash;&ndash;sure it
will, Rathburn! They&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m you, see, an&#8217; light
right out after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn laid one hand on the old man&#8217;s shoulder
and put the other over Joe&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, you&#8217;re all excited&ndash;&ndash;plumb unreasonable excited.
You know I wouldn&#8217;t let you do that.
Now don&#8217;t hand me more worries than I&#8217;ve got.
Be good, Joe.&#8221; He patted Price&#8217;s shoulder, then
swung into the saddle.</p>
<p>The old miner looked up at him, his face showing
strangely white in the dim starlight, pierced by
the fire on the peak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell &#8217;em you&#8217;d been here, Roger; don&#8217;t forget
that!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, Joe,&#8221; Rathburn chuckled. &#8220;So
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly he rode down the little meadow below
the spring into the deep shadows of the ca&ntilde;on
which led down a steep trail to the desert. Presently
he checked his pace until he was walking the gallant
dun. He wished to avoid as much noise as possible,
and to save the horse for a final spurt down nine
miles of desert to the Mallory ranch from the
mouth of the ca&ntilde;on&ndash;&ndash;providing he got out.</p>
<p>For two reasons he had deliberately chosen this
route: it was shortest, and it offered the best going.
He must save the dun&#8217;s strength. Rathburn knew
the limits of his splendid mount; knew they had
almost been reached; knew there was just enough
left in the horse to make the ranch without killing
him. The Coyote would surrender before he would
kill his horse to effect his escape or gain an objective!</p>
<p>Thus they slipped down the narrow ca&ntilde;on, with
the desert stars gleaming white above the lava hills
of Imagination Range, while the fire glowed on the
peak above Joe Price&#8217;s cabin. Rathburn&#8217;s face was
pale under his tan; his thoughts were in a turmoil,
but his lips were pressed into a fine line that denoted
an unwavering determination. Had Sheriff Bob
Long seen his face at this time he might have
glimpsed another angle of Rathburn&#8217;s many-sided
character&ndash;&ndash;an angle which would have given him
pause.</p>
<p>Rathburn looked behind, and his eyes narrowed.
Two fires were burning on the peak.</p>
<p>Already the watchers were cognizant of his latest
move and were signaling to those who might be
below. He wondered vaguely why they had not
surrounded Joe Price&#8217;s cabin while he had been there.
Then he realized he had been there hardly long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
enough for his pursuers to get there in any number.
Suddenly his thoughts were broken into by a streak
of red in the ca&ntilde;on depths below him. He swerved
close against the rock wall, drew his gun, and,
speaking to the dun, drove in his spurs.</p>
<p>A short distance below he could see the faint
glow of the starlight night and knew he was near
the ca&ntilde;on&#8217;s mouth. There were more streaks of
red, and bullets whistled past him. Then Rathburn
raised his gun and sent half its deadly contents
crashing down into the trail ahead.</p>
<p>There followed a few moments of quiet, broken
only by the harsh, ringing pound of his mount&#8217;s
hoofs. Rathburn could see open country just ahead.
Then a flash of fire came from almost under him,
and the big dun lunged into the air, half twisting,
and came down upon some object under its hoofs.
The dun bounded on in great leaps, literally flying
through the air, as Rathburn thrilled with the knowledge
that the horse had knocked down the man who
had sought to kill him.</p>
<p>From above came sharp reports, and the blackness
of the high ca&ntilde;on walls was streaked with spurts of
flame. Leaden death hurled itself into the rock
trail behind him. Then he was out of the ca&ntilde;on,
riding like mad through the white desert night toward
his goal&ndash;&ndash;the Mallory ranch!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Laura Mallory stood on the porch of the little
ranch house, staring out across the dimly lit spaces
of desert. A worried look appeared in her eyes.
The front door was open, and in the small sitting
room her father was reading under a shaded lamp
at the table. At times the worried look in the girl&#8217;s
eyes would change to one of wistfulness, and twice
the tears welled.</p>
<p>Presently she straightened and listened intently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
looking into the south instead of northwest. Her
ears, keen as are those of the desert born, had caught
a sound&ndash;&ndash;a succession of faint sounds&ndash;&ndash;in the still
night air. Gradually the sound became more and
more distinct, and the worried expression of her
face increased. She hurried into the sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, Fred Doane is coming out from town,&#8221;
she said breathlessly. &#8220;Do you suppose they&#8217;ve got
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so, girlie,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;It was
a bold business, an&#8217; what could you expect?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t seem to understand.
All this trouble is coming so suddenly. Father, are
you sure you heard Roger refuse to aid that man
Eagen in some shady scheme last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ab-so-lutely,&#8221; declared Mallory. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
wondering, daughter, if he didn&#8217;t turn Eagen down
because he had this scheme of his own.&#8221;</p>
<p>The purr of a motor came to them from outside,
and Laura, hastily wiping her eyes with a
small handkerchief, went slowly out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura!&#8221; cried Fred Doane, as he came up the
steps, holding out his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&ndash;&ndash;what is it, Fred?&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;Have
they caught&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Doane briskly, as Mallory appeared
in the door. &#8220;An&#8217; they probably won&#8217;t get
him. He&#8217;s clever, that fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bank cashier indulged in a frown, but he
was plainly nervous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what news do you bring here?&#8221; Mallory
demanded. &#8220;Did you come to tell us he&#8217;d got away
clean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, not&ndash;&ndash;not exactly,&#8221; said Doane. &#8220;I meant
to tell you that, of course, but I also want to
have a little talk with Laura. Can I see you alone,
Laura, for a few minutes?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>that&#8217;s</i> it,&#8221; snorted Mallory, as he stamped
back into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have something to tell me you don&#8217;t want
father to hear?&#8221; asked the girl in a worried voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura, there&#8217;s something I must tell you right
away,&#8221; said Doane nervously, leading her to the
shadow of the far end of the porch. There he
turned and faced her, taking her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura, you must have seen it for a long time.
You could hardly help but see it. I love you,
Laura&ndash;&ndash;I love you with all my heart, and I want
you to be my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl drew back in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why do you have to tell me this so suddenly?&#8221;
she asked, her color coming and going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I want you to marry me, Laura, to-night!&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>Again he reached for her hands. &#8220;Please, Laura,&#8221;
he pleaded. &#8220;It means so much to me. Don&#8217;t
you care for me, sweetheart? I&#8217;ve been led to
think you did, and I intended to tell you soon, but
all this trouble&ndash;&ndash;this terrible trouble to-day&ndash;&ndash;has
nearly driven me mad. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll go mad,
Laura, if I don&#8217;t have something else to think
about. Oh, Laura, marry me and help me out of
this big trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fred!&#8221; exclaimed the girl, startled by his passion
of pleading. &#8220;Fred, I&#8217;ve never tried to make you
think I cared for you. And now&ndash;&ndash;well, I&#8217;d have
to have a long time to think it over. How would
it help you out of trouble, Fred? Tell me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By helping me forget&ndash;&ndash;by helping me forget that
our bank is ruined! By saving my mind! By
keeping me from going mad! By&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fred you must not talk so. That robbery has
unnerved you for the time being, that&#8217;s all. You&#8217;re
excited and so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more than excited,&#8221; he declared, trying to
put his hands on her shoulders. &#8220;I&#8217;m about&ndash;&ndash;about&ndash;&ndash;<i>gone</i>!
Laura, marry me to-night, and we&#8217;ll go
somewhere&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll go somewhere right from here,
from this ranch&ndash;&ndash;go a long way and get married in
the morning. Then we can stay away for a short
time till I get to be myself again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Fred,&#8221; replied the girl in convincing tones,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t. It would be asking too much even if
I loved you. Come inside, and I&#8217;ll make you some
strong tea. You can talk to father and me and
regain control of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence. Mallory with
the lamp had come to the door at the sound of
Doane&#8217;s loud voice. He was looking at them.
Then out of the night came the pound of hoofs.
There was no mistaking the sound.</p>
<p>Doane whirled around, as a rider came out of
the sea of mesquite and greasewood and flung himself
from the saddle in front of the porch. The
bank cashier turned toward Mallory. His face was
haggard. He seemed to sway, as the rider came
stamping up the steps. He darted for the door,
but had hardly got inside before the rider caught
him and made him face about. Mallory hurried in
with the lamp, followed by the girl.</p>
<p>Doane was quailing before the new arrival. Both
cried out, as they saw it was Eagen who had broken
out so suddenly. Eagen towered above the shrinking
Doane.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you thought you&#8217;d double cross me, did you,
eh?&#8221; came Eagen&#8217;s harsh voice, and he slapped Doane
in the face.</p>
<p>Doane went red, then white. For a moment intense
hatred and anger flashed in his eyes, but
he made no move to avenge the insult. Slowly
the light in his eyes died again to fear, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
realized his inability to cope with this man of
strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Eagen, you can&#8217;t come into my house and
act like that,&#8221; said Mallory stoutly, putting the lamp
on the table.</p>
<p>Laura still stood in the doorway, stunned by the
rapid and extraordinary turn of events. Eagen
turned on Mallory with a snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, you old fool! Don&#8217;t butt in where
you ain&#8217;t wanted, an&#8217; on something you don&#8217;t know
anything about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re in my house!&#8221; Mallory retorted
sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll only be here a minute,&#8221; said Eagen with a
sneer. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; out of your house, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to drag this sneaking cur out with me&ndash;&ndash;out on the
solid ground an&#8217; give him what&#8217;s comin&#8217; to him.
An&#8217; then,&#8221; he added in a terrible voice; &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to go out an&#8217; get his pardner&ndash;&ndash;Rathburn, The Coyote&ndash;&ndash;get
him when the others can&#8217;t come within a mile
of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t take this man out of my house when
he is my guest!&#8221; thundered Mallory.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; asked Eagen contemptuously. &#8220;Well, you
watch an&#8217; see! If you try to stop me you&#8217;ll stop
lead!&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaped forward and grasped Doane by the
shoulder, jerked him forward, and stepped backward
himself. He turned, dragging his victim, then
stopped dead in his tracks with a hissing intake
of breath. Rathburn was standing quietly in the
doorway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>THE LOOT</h3>
</div>
<p>In the heat of the threats and counterthreats which
had been in progress, none of the occupants of
the room had heard the newest arrival thunder up
to the porch and leap from the saddle to the steps.</p>
<p>Eagen was dumfounded by Rathburn&#8217;s sudden
appearance. He saw that the girl was standing now
in a front corner of the room, with her hands
crossed on her breast, a look of horror in her eyes.
Slowly Eagen recovered and loosed his hold on
Doane, who staggered weakly to the table and
leaned upon it. Eagen&#8217;s sneer returned to his thick
lips, and his narrowed gaze traveled quickly to a
sack which Rathburn held in his left hand. Eagen&#8217;s
eyes shone with fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here to fix up the divvy!&#8221; he choked.
&#8220;I knew it was a put-up job between you an&#8217;
Doane, an&#8217; I figured you&#8217;d maybe meet aroun&#8217;
here where Doane would be sure to come to try
an&#8217; take this woman with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn eyed him calmly. There was something
of a deadly calm in his very posture, as he stood
just within the threshold. He looked past Eagen to
Doane. Then he tossed the sack on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the money I took this morning, Doane,&#8221;
he said in matter-of-fact tones. &#8220;I came here to
turn it over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With bulging eyes Doane stared at him.</p>
<p>Eagen laughed loudly. &#8220;That&#8217;s rich! Tryin&#8217; to
make me think you was goin&#8217; to give it <i>all</i> to him?
Don&#8217;t you figure, Mr. Coyote, that I can throw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
my rope aroun&#8217; a simple scheme like you an&#8217; that
shivering rat over by the table cooked up? That&#8217;s
why you turned down my little proposition last night.
It was this same deal&ndash;&ndash;only, <i>me</i>, an&#8217; Doane there
was goin&#8217; to put it over. You figured I&#8217;d cut you
out of your divvy, an&#8217; you figured right; he suspected
I might double cross him, an&#8217; maybe he was
right, too. So he cooked it up with you to pull the
robbery, thinkin&#8217; you&#8217;d be more likely to go through
an&#8217; give him his end. But the pair of you figured
too many points when you thought I wouldn&#8217;t
catch on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what your proposition was to be,
was it?&#8221; asked Rathburn pleasantly. &#8220;Rob the bank?
Why, I didn&#8217;t need a gang to rob the bank, Eagen,
an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t have anybody in with me. The trouble
with you is that you&#8217;ve got too much imagination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drawl in which Rathburn concluded his
speech drove Eagen to a frenzy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie, Rathburn!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn smiled. &#8220;I might as well tell you that
I intended to get away with that money that&#8217;s on
the table, Eagen. That&#8217;s what I took it for. I&#8217;m
making this little statement because something&#8217;s liable
to happen to one, or both of us. I didn&#8217;t know
Doane was cashier of the bank when I took it.
I only recently learned that fact. Then I brought
it back to turn over to him, not so much on his
account as on account of Miss Mallory. I understand
Doane is a very good friend of Miss Mallory.
I wouldn&#8217;t want his bank hurt for that reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Laura Mallory who cried out at this. She
walked toward Rathburn, although he did not look
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you do it, Roger?&#8221; she asked in a
trembling voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you <i>that</i>, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But I know!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve guessed it. You
saw Mr. Doane and me together in Hope to-day
and remembered he was at the ranch last night,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say any more, Laura!&#8221; Rathburn commanded
sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be still, daughter; it&#8217;s best,&#8221; said Mallory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither she, nor you, nor Doane, nor all of you
together can talk me out of it!&#8221; roared Eagen. &#8220;It
was a frame-up!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the deadly stillness that followed, Laura Mallory
shrank back from the sight of two gunmen looking
steadily into each other&#8217;s eyes, their hands ready
for the lightning draw&ndash;&ndash;each waiting for the merest
suggestion of the beginning of a move on the part
of the other to get his weapon into action. But
the draws did not come. The pregnant silence was
broken by the thundering roll of many horses galloping
into the yard about the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; yelled Eagen in a voice of triumph.
&#8220;There&#8217;s your sweet little posse, Coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected to see Bob Long when I came down
here!&#8221; said Rathburn coolly, looking at Laura Mallory
for the first time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>THE TEST OF A MAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Several men stamped across the porch to the
jingle of spur chains. Others broke in through
the back door and entered the kitchen. Sheriff Bob
Long appeared at the door, with two guns leveled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re covered from both doors and all the
windows, Rathburn!&#8221; he said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s almost just what I thought, sheriff,&#8221; Rathburn
drawled.</p>
<p>Long stepped into the room, shoving his guns into
their holsters. Many other guns were covering
Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of all this, anyway?&#8221; demanded
Long with a puzzled expression on his face.
His eyes widened, as he saw the bag of money
on the table. &#8220;Is that the money that was taken
from your bank this morning Mr. Doane?&#8221; he asked
sharply.</p>
<p>Doane nodded weakly. The sheriff looked at
Rathburn curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought it back? You was up to Joe Price&#8217;s
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I brought it back, sheriff,&#8221; said Rathburn
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be frank and tell you, Rathburn, that
if you expect leniency after what happened this
morning you might just as well give up that idea.
Any man can change his mind when he sees he can&#8217;t
get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you, sheriff,&#8221; replied Rathburn,
taking tobacco and papers from his shirt pocket.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
&#8220;As I was just tellin&#8217; our friend, Mr. Eagen, I
brought it back on purpose, an&#8217; I expected to see
you when I got here. I came near not gettin&#8217;
here at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You took a long chance,&#8221; scowled Long. &#8220;But
it won&#8217;t get you much now at this stage of the
game&ndash;&ndash;especially after the way you led me to believe
this morning that you were thinking of giving yourself
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagen&#8217;s laugh startled them.</p>
<p>&#8220;He brought it back to give it up an&#8217; himself,
too?&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;He brought it back, sheriff,
because he an&#8217; that rat of a Doane planned this
thing. Coyote got away with the money an&#8217; came
back here to divvy up with Doane. Didn&#8217;t Doane
make the same kind of a proposition to me? Didn&#8217;t
he tell me he was short in his accounts, an&#8217; it
could be covered up if the bank was robbed, for
then he could say more money was took than really
was? I&#8217;ll say he did. An&#8217; I was goin&#8217; to see
if he&#8217;d go through with it, an&#8217; then I was going
to wise you up so we could get him cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>With knitted brows the sheriff stared at Eagen,
then looked at the white-faced Doane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; the truth!&#8221; shouted Eagen
at the shaking bank cashier. &#8220;You can&#8217;t get out
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a tense moment.</p>
<p>Doane shook his head weakly; he was a picture
of guilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got scared I wouldn&#8217;t go through with the
play, sheriff,&#8221; Eagen continued. &#8220;Thought maybe
I&#8217;d make off with all the kale. So he framed it
with Rathburn, an&#8217; I caught &#8217;em about to divide it
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lies!&#8221; screamed Doane. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t frame it
with Rathburn. I can prove it. That man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
pointed a shaking finger at Eagen&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;has come to
me with threats and made me take securities I knew
were stolen. There&#8217;s some of them in the bank
now. Some of the stuff he took from the stage
driver yesterday is there! He&#8217;s pulled job after
job&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagen, recovering from his amazement at the
man&#8217;s outbreak, leaped and drove his powerful fist
against Doane&#8217;s jaw, knocking him nearly the length
of the room, where he crashed with his head against
the stones of the fireplace. Eagen turned quickly.
His eyes were blazing red.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the man!&#8221; he yelled wrathfully. &#8220;You&#8217;re
the yellow Coyote&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His right hand went to his gun, as there came
a crashing report. He staggered back, trying to
get out the weapon which had not left his holster.
He sank down to his knees, still glaring death at
the man above him, still fumbling at his gun. Then
he lurched forward on his face.</p>
<p>Rathburn flipped his smoking pistol so that its
barrel landed in his hand. Then he tendered it, butt
foremost, to Sheriff Bob Long. Long took it and
threw it on the table, looking first at Rathburn, then
at the dead man on the floor. He waved toward the
doors and windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys can draw back,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>Mallory stepped to the fallen Doane. The man&#8217;s
face had set in a white cast. He felt his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did for him,&#8221; he said, rising.</p>
<p>Laura Mallory came walking slowly up to the
sheriff. Her face was ghastly after what she had
witnessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff Long,&#8221; she said in a voice strangely
calm, &#8220;we heard Eagen&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;she shuddered, as she
mentioned the name&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;ask Roger&ndash;&ndash;ask Mr. Rathburn
last night to help with some job that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
get them a lot of money. It may be that&ndash;&ndash;that&ndash;&ndash;Fred
did plan such a thing. I&#8217;m sorry to say it, but
Fred had seemed awfully nervous lately, and to-night
he came to me and asked me to run away with him&ndash;&ndash;at
once. He seemed horribly afraid of something.
Anyway, Roger refused to go in with Eagen, and an
examination of Fred&#8217;s books will tell all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated. Then she spoke slowly and softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know why Roger robbed the bank and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, Laura!&#8221; cried Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Laura firmly; &#8220;you may be going to
prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put out one hand in protest.</p>
<p>Turning again to the sheriff she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger did go to town last night, intending to
give himself up. I knew he was going to do it by
the way he looked at me. But to-day he saw me
with Mr. Doane, and maybe he&#8217;s heard things for
which there was no warrant. Anyway, I know he
thought I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;was in love with Fred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura&ndash;&ndash;please!&#8221; Rathburn pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to-night,&#8221; said the girl in triumph, &#8220;he
heard Fred was cashier of the bank he&#8217;d robbed, and
he brought the money back because he thought the
robbery would hurt Fred and in that way hurt me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn turned appealingly to the sheriff. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;He robbed that bank because he thought I had
betrayed his trust, Sheriff Long!&#8221; cried Laura, her
eyes shining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going, Long?&#8221; cried Rathburn in an
agony.</p>
<p>The sheriff stepped to the door and called to some
of his men who entered and bore the bodies of
Doane and Eagen out of the sitting room. Then he
took the money sack from the table and indicated to
Rathburn to follow him, as he went out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
door. Rathburn went after him quickly, and the
girl ran to the porch. Rathburn drew back with
a cry, as he reached the porch. Just beyond the
steps a horse was lying on its side.</p>
<p>&#8220;My&ndash;&ndash;my hoss!&#8221; he cried wonderingly.</p>
<p>He leaped down beside the dead beast. Then he
saw crimson upon the animal&#8217;s shoulder, as a little
gleam of light came from the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was why he jumped on the trail. He was
hit. He carried me all this way with a bullet in him
an&#8217; then dropped! One of Long&#8217;s men shot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rathburn looked about vacantly. Then he sank
down and buried his face on the shoulder of the
dun, as Sheriff Long turned away. Laura Mallory
stepped quickly to the side of the sheriff and touched
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he as bad as you think, sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>Long scowled at her in the dim light from the door,
took out a thick, black cigar, bit the end off savagely,
and began to chew it. He walked abruptly out to
where some of his men were standing by their
horses, and he said something in an undertone. When
he returned, Rathburn had taken the saddle and
bridle off the dead horse and was throwing the
leather on the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours, dad,&#8221; he called to Mallory; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
use &#8217;em again if I could.&#8221; Then he turned to the
sheriff. &#8220;All right, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come inside,&#8221; said Long gruffly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>TEN MILES&#8217; START</h3>
</div>
<p>When they were in the sitting room the sheriff
confronted Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a queer case for me,&#8221; he said
slowly, with an attempt at harshness. &#8220;I knew
Eagen was up to a lot of dirty work, but I never
could fasten anything on him till to-night. I&#8217;ll get
some of the rest of the gang now. Doane showed
in his face that he was guilty. Those things don&#8217;t
worry me none. But <i>you</i> are the hardest character
I ever had to handle, Rathburn!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t figure on givin&#8217; you any more trouble,
sheriff,&#8221; Rathburn assured him, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the puzzle of it!&#8221; Long exploded. &#8220;That
puts it up to me. I know you had reason for giving
Gomez his, and I know this girl wouldn&#8217;t lie about
the other. But&ndash;&ndash;well, I don&#8217;t get you a-tall, Rathburn,
and that&#8217;s a fact. Something tells me I&#8217;ve got
to give you a chance, and if I knew what tells me
this I&#8217;d wring its neck!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped close to Rathburn and looked him
straight in the eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take one of Mallory&#8217;s horses. He&#8217;s got some
good ones. I give you ten miles in any direction.
If you can make it&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s your candy. But remember,
Rathburn, I&#8217;m going to try to stop you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked swiftly out of the door, leaving Rathburn
staring at the smiling girl.</p>
<p>Laura stepped close to him and nodded. Rathburn
shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see where I&#8217;ve got the right to give Long
any more trouble.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But he isn&#8217;t letting you go, Roger. He&#8217;s putting
it up to you, and he means what he says when
he declares he&#8217;ll try to get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he does, he&#8217;ll probably get me,&#8221; mused Rathburn.</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe he won&#8217;t get <i>us</i>, Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I, Roger. Listen! There&#8217;s a land &#8217;way
up north, Roger. I&#8217;ve read about it. It&#8217;s past the
desert and the mountains and the plains&ndash;&ndash;in another
country! And there&#8217;s a river there, Roger&ndash;&ndash;a river
they call Peace River. I&#8217;ve always loved the name.
We&#8217;ll go there, Roger, you and I&ndash;&ndash;and father can
come later.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with shining eyes and put
her arms about his neck, and she saw the unbelievable
wonder in his face. The man trembled. Then
he took her and held her and kissed her, time after
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Price said I could never be satisfied away
from the desert unless I took along something that
was of it,&#8221; he muttered hoarsely; &#8220;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Roger, he meant me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t make it,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;Not the two
of us&ndash;&ndash;but Laura, girlie, <i>this</i> is worth the game!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes we can, Roger,&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;Think!
We can be married when we&#8217;ve left the desert. It&#8217;s
not quite ten miles to Boxall Ca&ntilde;on. We can go up
Boxall over the range and cross Death Flat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of that, sweetheart,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But no horse can get up Boxall, an&#8217; if he did he
couldn&#8217;t get across Death Flat. Few men have
crossed that stretch. It&#8217;s well named. I might try
it alone; but you&ndash;&ndash;no, Laura. It just ain&#8217;t in the
pictures!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need horses, Roger. You&#8217;ve forgotten
the burros. They&#8217;ll kill any horse on the desert,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
won&#8217;t they? We can take two or three loaded with
food and water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s miles and miles an&#8217; then some&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; it all
looks alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when we&#8217;ve reached the other side, Roger?&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew away from her and stepped to the door.
He could not see or hear anything. When he turned
and again approached her, his face was white. He
looked at Mallory, who was standing with a look of
stupefaction on his lined face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; he said and stepped into another room.
In a few moments he was back, holding a money
belt in his hands. He took out gold and bills and
deposited the money on the table.</p>
<p>The others stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s about six thousand there, Mallory. It&#8217;s
gamblin&#8217; money. Turn it in to the bank to make or
help out Doane&#8217;s shortage. I&#8217;ve got just twenty-five
hundred left which I earned in a better way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, get the burros!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Sheriff Bob Long looked down from a ledge above
a narrow, deep, boulder-strewn, awe-inspiring ca&ntilde;on
and drew in his breath sharply. Below he saw two
human beings and three animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew he&#8217;d try it,&#8221; Long said wonderingly to
himself. &#8220;I thought he&#8217;d try it afoot. But the girl!
And they&#8217;re going to try to cross Death Flat!&#8221;</p>
<p>His look of wonder increased, and he made no
move toward the weapons in his holsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder now,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;Can they make it?
I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He scowled and looked about with a frowning
stare. His gaze again shifted downward. Suddenly
he shrugged and put the wrong end of his unlighted
cigar in his mouth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the queerest cigar I ever had,&#8221; he growled,
as he made his way to his horse. &#8220;It won&#8217;t stay lit
because it wants to be swallowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He mounted and rode slowly back toward the far-reaching
stretches of desert. Once he halted and
turned in his saddle for a backward look.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the makings of the worst bad man this
country ever saw,&#8221; he muttered aloud. &#8220;Now, if
that woman and another country&ndash;&ndash;but first they&#8217;ve
got to get across.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On the western edge of a great, ghastly plain of
white, in which a deceiving, distant glow was mirrored
in the desert dawn, two figures, a man and a
girl, stood hand in hand. Three shaggy burros,
heavily laden, stood behind them. The burros saw
not the Death Flat ahead, for they were asleep.</p>
<p>And the man and the girl saw not the frightful
white, as of powdered skulls, bare, sinister, sunbaked,
but a vision of a little house in a fragrant
green meadow, with golden fields on either side of a
peaceful river, and forests ranging up to distant hills.</p>
